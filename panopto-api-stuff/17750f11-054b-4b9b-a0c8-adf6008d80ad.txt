Title: L19 - A 32-bit Processor - Sequencing and Output Logic
Category: COMP40001 - Introduction to Computer Systems (Autumn 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Bjoern Schuller
Date: 06/12/2021
Let it come to a final lecture lecture 19, the 32 bit processor, and now finally,
0:01
what is left to be done is to do the sequencing and output logic for the controller.
0:08
Now, if you remember, we you the data passes in this lecture,
0:14
we have now the manual process of put together with the memory, and we extended it a little bit.
0:18
We skipped the results register and row directly into memory, for example,
0:23
and we added these seven registers here on the left hand side with a multiplex that you
0:27
select which one is going to be fed into a or B registers which belong to the hardware?
0:33
Well, guys, we also have now this controller here, and that is the piece actually,
0:39
that we still have to do to connect everything and introduce the tape machine that executes the fetch and execution so I can.
0:45
He also specified an instruction set that is important for us to know how many cycles each instruction has and of course,
0:57
to give us a specification of what can be done and how it should be done.
1:04
So just if you remember, for example, we had load was a destination, registered an address with three cycles that you remember.
1:09
The lengthiest one was load indirect where we had a source underestimation register, which took four cycles to execute.
1:18
And some showed ones were like jump to an address or something of the programme,
1:28
kind of from the memory data register and in the operation, which was even shorter.
1:32
Basically with zero cycles, we had specified a 32 bit instruction register depending on the kind of instruction we had an up code,
1:39
always a 24 to 31, sometimes destination and source registers and address, depending on the kind of command.
1:50
Now, what we need to do, really is to design of a controller that guides us through these fetch and execute steps.
1:59
The controller sequence looks simple, but we have one problem what should the input signals be?
2:06
So we have the same machine that has to do three fetch steps and then these up to four execute ones,
2:14
and you can see the branch is back to fetch one, depending on the command.
2:22
It could back go back from fetch three already when inside the case, obviously inauguration, it doesn't need to execute something.
2:26
Then we have those was a single execution step, like the jump example and then up to four to be done and the load in direct case.
2:34
So but really, what is the input to this controller?
2:46
And we need to design a combinatorial circuit with one output.
2:51
See if C equals one. We continue to the next execution states.
2:56
But if zero equals zero, we have finished and can fetch the next instruction.
3:02
So in other words, we want to have the controller just have one input and that this is just kind of continue or not,
3:07
which we are used to already from our execution controller.
3:12
If you remember the state machine with the five execution in one idle state.
3:16
Similarly, here only that we do not go into an idle state, but we go back to fetch depending on the sea, and we need to do this combinatorial circuit,
3:22
which gives us the one input signal to this controller to decide whether we should go to the next state or go back to fetch one.
3:32
So if equals one, we continue to the next execution, say, but a sequel zero three have finished and can fetch the next instruction,
3:46
which means that C obviously depends on the instruction that we're executing and the inputs of this combinatorial circuit will be the instruction,
3:52
opcode bits and the state.
4:00
So in order to know whether we should go back, we need to know the instruction we're executing and which state we are being in.
4:03
Hence, this will be our combinatorial circuit here, and we have here cues to know the state Q zero one two.
4:14
Why? Because we need three bits to encode the over all seven different states here fetch one two three and execute one to four overall seven.
4:24
Hence, we will need three d time flip flops and go to state.
4:34
And then we have the instruction registered top eight bits that will be the input to a combinatorial circuit to then give us this variable C,
4:37
which actually then in the end is the input to this final submission.
4:45
And we will be using decoders heavily now because we need to be more functional and be more.
4:52
Problem solving. So we will approach this problem of designing this and the further steps functionally again,
5:01
making use of decoders or if your Memoji multiplexes, or if you remember binary to unwary converters, all the same thing.
5:10
And first one we will be using is to be decoding the instruction register top.
5:17
It's the top eight ones where we have the instruction of code.
5:22
So we need an eight to two hundred fifty six decoder to decode which instruction is currently being present.
5:26
So we decode the opcode, the top eight bits of the instruction register, and if you remember, of course,
5:38
the multiplex or binary to unmarried converter always has only one of its outputs being one at a time one of the other ones or zeroes.
5:43
So we really know which construction is being executed right now.
5:51
The input, of course, is that all these eight top bits from the construction register and the big advantage
5:55
is that we decode the input into which instruction is currently being executed.
6:01
So only one open line is non-zero for any input that indicates the instruction that is being executed.
6:09
Now we're looking at instructions with the same stage sequence and plus them,
6:20
so having a decode of the instructions, we can now consider them as binary variables in our design.
6:24
And of course, all instructions have the same stage sequence,
6:30
though different arithmetic functions we have done with zero execution one to three and only one was four, actually.
6:33
But you get the picture. We now try to cluster those,
6:40
which are the same number of execution steps because that is what matters now for our
6:43
C inputs to the control of Signal to let it know whether it should go back to fetch
6:48
one or continue along the line with the execution steps so we can implement simple
6:54
circuits for these Boolean variables and arithmetic functions from Boolean equations.
6:59
So, for example, we can cluster everything as X, which is add or subtract or end or exclusive,
7:07
or we can put together shifts as a variable from arithmetic shift left out of makeshift right or rotate right.
7:16
We can put together skips with skip or skip positive or negative, so we really have an ability and variable and we can,
7:25
of course, also put that into circuitry, as we can always do Boolean equations.
7:33
Next, we need to do the state assignments. We make the state assignments for the fetch and execute states.
7:41
Remember, we have seven states three fetch, four execute and said we will need three flip flops in this case, of course.
7:48
And we're using a suited state assignment here.
7:57
Let's not bother with details, we have one unused state also because we would have eight available and only need seven.
8:01
And, of course, the midterms here are coming from these assignments here, so zero zero zero here means,
8:09
of course, that the midterm is his and not Q1 and Q2, not same for everything else.
8:15
That's just what we always said.
8:22
Now we will also use a decoder here to decode which state we are in, to make our life easy and have another set of Bulleen variables.
8:26
So having defined our states and we can all use a three to eight decoder to give us one billion variable for each state,
8:33
that makes it very easy later on. And how do we do the assignment here?
8:42
Well, it comes from our state assignment table here.
8:48
So zero zero zero is the topmost output here by convention.
8:52
So this should be fetch one, whereas the next in line would be zero zero one,
8:57
which here is fetch three and fetch three is the next one here, then the next one and zero one one.
9:04
And so on and so forth. So the assignment here comes directly from this table here.
9:16
So now we have a harder line to tell us both the state and the instruction or group of instructions because we have these cluster
9:23
variables for several instructions to put them together being executed and we can use all these as Boolean variables in our hover design,
9:30
making it very easy not to come up with this C input to the controller because we can simply write
9:38
building equations to define when the finite state machine needs to return to fetch a new instruction,
9:46
or, in other words, when it meets return to fetch one F1, for example, we can go through a register transfer tables,
9:52
which we adds nicely, put together and find all the instructions that need exactly two execution cycles.
9:59
So the tables we are done in the last lecture and thus determine that the condition for returning from E two is E two.
10:05
So we are in execute two state and the command is being returned or shifts.
10:13
Remember, these are class of variables for arithmetic shift left, right and rotate.
10:21
Or move or jump in direct. Why?
10:27
Because in the tables, we can see that all those commands are finished off to execute to.
10:30
So if we are an execute two and we are executing any of these commands.
10:36
Then we should return and and because we say return means that the sea variable has to be zero.
10:44
We need to avoid it at the end. So if executed to a holds and one of these here holds, this would be one.
10:51
But in order to return, we do find that the seas should be zero. Hence we have the prime year at the end or we invert everything.
11:00
But the idea is clear I hope we introduce all these Boolean variables to make our life easy with the multiplexes,
11:07
and now we can write Bulleen equations to say when we should return.
11:15
This was one example from. And of course, we can go through the tables we specified last time and see for each execution phase,
11:18
which at commands or codes, and after that execution stage.
11:28
So we repeat the process for each state, whether the state machine can branch back to state of one.
11:35
And we get the following overall boolean equations. Here is our equation.
11:40
We just looked into four execute two. But we also have the case of no operation, which goes without any execution immediately back.
11:45
So the first one here is a three where off the first three were already returning to fetch one because the opcode was no operation.
11:54
In execute one, we have Skip's clear or jump as the ones that are finished off to execute one and execute two.
12:03
We already talked about execute three. We have compared Desmond decrements or increment compare ETS or indirect and load.
12:10
As the ones that are finished after three or so indirect or load, and finally, of course, you would have executed four.
12:22
But after execute four, we only now go back to fetch one. So no extra reason to to do something.
12:29
You know, to combine all these conditions, we're using ends here.
12:36
So see is. Accordingly.
12:42
The overall combination with ends of any of these conditions here.
12:50
With a bit of care, we can implement this directly in hardware, and we will get our secretary for this.
12:57
Now we designed the state sequence in logic, and we can use the usual way we do this.
13:04
First of all, we do right on our table, you know that we did the assignment already.
13:11
So this is coming from the earlier table here where we did the assignment in some way that is beneficial for us.
13:16
We didn't talk about this, but you remember from former lectures that the assignment does make an influence.
13:23
And we're now using this assignment.
13:29
And at the same time, we have now the extended version of this table where we have the input variable considered here.
13:31
See? And the next stage. So in the previous table, realities of the assignment, for the stage, for the binary assignment of the here.
13:37
But no, we also entered into this table, the input variable and the next state.
13:46
If C is zero, this means.
13:54
That during fetch we continue was fetching so from fetch when we go to fetch to fetch two to three,
13:59
but from fetch three already we would go back to f one because we do not execute.
14:07
So the input variable, if you remember, tells us if you go through executed, if we go back to fetch.
14:13
So in any other state which is executed, including a three even a scene and see a zero.
14:18
Of course, we go back to fetch one because this means that the current opcode is finished and it doesn't have more execution cycles, so we go back.
14:24
However, in the other case, continue sort of see imagine that continue as one means simply that we go through all these cycles.
14:33
So in the first three was continue or see as an input one,
14:44
we go on to execute one from one to two from two to three from three to four and ultimately, of course, from executed four back to fetch one.
14:47
Because then we are done because that's the maximum number of execution cycles we meet.
14:56
Remember also that we had one unused state each so independent of C.
15:02
Of course, we don't care about the next stage. OK, that's our big table, and from that, we put it into the camps.
15:06
We have done this repeatedly throughout the course and you can imagine how we do this.
15:16
We need to respect the input variable and the right state assignments and then fill in from this table to the camps for each flip-flopped zero,
15:21
one and two. And after our circling of once and John Kerry's attributes, note here that John Kerry's almost by an asterix.
15:32
We come up with our momentum based equations here for thirty one and zero.
15:43
Now India zero, you can see that we could simplify was an exclusive or if you wanted to, uh, to to summarise here.
15:49
Because we have here. Q one prime and Q to prime or Q1 and Q2 zero.
16:01
Did I say Q2? Sorry, Q1 Prime and Q zero prime or Q1 and Q zero fee pool Q two prime ad of a bracket.
16:09
So the three is replaced here by this exclusive. But remember that we have already have our multiplex are in place to multiplex or so we can.
16:20
Make use of the fact that we have the states explicitly decoded and more easily rewrite this year using our Boolean variables,
16:31
fetch one or fetch to or see and execute three four zero.
16:43
Similarly, here we're replacing buy or fetch one and use see here as well to make life easier.
16:48
So the final circuit done is easier or simpler than expected.
16:57
Remember, we have our instruction decoder wired up with the instruction register bits,
17:02
top eight bits such that we get our two hundred fifty six output lines for.
17:06
The different instructions. We also have our state decoder from the her flip flops here, such that we know on which side we are here,
17:13
we have our common and logic for giving us the key variable here.
17:24
And with the correct wiring up of what we just got here, we have our stage sequencing logic in place.
17:30
Of course, we need to check the drone carriers and to see if the secret will be safe at start up.
17:42
But it is, and we need to add extra hardware to make the process to do something particular start up and maybe also on a signal from a reset button.
17:48
So checking the drone cares is not a major issue here because we would at this kind of safety routine anyhow
17:57
to make sure that we know what's happening and sort of know that is our state machine for the controller.
18:05
But of course, now we also need the output logic, and this would be a huge combinatorial design problem.
18:12
Why we have the following inputs the states. If one of two up to for it and the instruction, at least the top 16.
18:18
Mm-Hmm. Why do we need more than the aid, because we also need the.
18:32
Instruction to to handle the multiplexes and so on, and you and shifter.
18:39
So the outputs are, on the other hand, side the clock controls C zero one two,
18:45
etc. The arithmetic function selection lines have zero of one, etc. and the multiplex and select lines.
18:52
In total, with the heads of 28 different combinatorial design problems for our outputs, each with 17 inputs.
19:01
And clearly, this is beyond the means of case maps,
19:11
so we need to think a little bit different than up to know we have been using the more finite state machine up to know.
19:14
If you remember, the more machine had no connexion between the inputs and the output logic.
19:21
So the input here in the more machine was only an input to the state machine.
19:25
But once we have the state, we only use the state.
19:32
So the output was only a function of the state,
19:37
not directly of the inputs of the input was not all wired up here such that this g function here was only dependent on the state.
19:39
And the state, of course, dependent on the input and the last state here, that was the moment it was safe home in terms of being safe and spikes.
19:48
But we now need to use the mealy machine and just see the big difference is that the input is also going directly into the function here.
19:58
So the output now is a function not only of the state but also the input.
20:08
And it is not possible to use some war machine sense in order to set up the process of correctly,
20:15
we need to know which instruction is being executed, obviously.
20:19
So if you want to have the outputs right for for the arithmetic function, select excellent multiplexes, for the select lines and so on.
20:23
Of course, we need to know the instruction that is currently being executed. And this means just depending on the states is not enough.
20:33
We need to know the input. Now, let's get started with the stop gates and the club gates signal 02 eight, maybe I want to remind us quickly in this.
20:40
Lay out these are the clock signals for the registers here on the free register a b
20:52
Kerry Control Programme code to address registered data register instruction registers.
21:00
So these clock signals and memory here we need to do know.
21:06
And we will again be using this typical gating circuit where we have the system clock and our respective variable for that respective register,
21:16
for example, to give for the memory address register gated with and then gate such that we use
21:29
the Falcon Edge because the rising arch has been used for the state machine.
21:35
We could also do it the other way around. Point being, we use one edge for the state machine and the other edge for the registers.
21:42
And then. This will be our clocks in at 11:00 and our case here, for example, for the memory address register.
21:50
Now, of course, we need to find this Boolean variable here and we will be doing this for the registers one by one.
21:59
So now we define first the memory address, register clock signal see more variable.
22:06
So we use the Bulleen algebraic and was our introduced variables to find the clock signals.
22:11
We look through the register. Sorry, yeah. Through the register transfer tables.
22:18
Again, we did in the last lecture to define our instruction set, and we look at all the places where the memory errors register is to be set.
22:22
And from that, we see that the memory address register is, of course, needed in fetch one.
22:31
Or an execute one, if it is a load or historical moment since right memory and the strategies that we need that followed in store or in execute,
22:37
you float in direct or store indirect execute to in this case because we needed to load also another register.
22:47
So that was an execute.
22:54
You know, I'm telling you this, but the best thing to do is also look through these tables yourself and see and find a little bit,
22:55
such as you familiarise yourself with the idea. What we really do is we go through the instruction set that we put together last lecture and see
23:04
in which case is which register used to come up with these early indications for the clock.
23:12
No, we don't care about registre contents, and that makes life easier at some moment in time,
23:23
so we need in practise the memory address at its edges register to be correct when we are about to load the memory data register.
23:31
So if you load the memory data register, we have to have the correct address and the memory address register.
23:40
But if you don't load the memory data register, we don't care what's in the memory address register so we can give it a clock pulse
23:46
and load random data on other times without disturbing the processor execution.
23:53
This allows us to simplify the equation for the memory address register because at some moments in some execution phases, we do not care.
23:58
So that makes it easier in the sense that we do not care which instructions actually execute it.
24:09
Because if it's not about load or store, but another instruction can still be loaded with something.
24:17
The memory address register that is. And we can simplify and just say or execute one same and execute two.
24:24
We don't really care if it's any other. Come on here. Then strategy prejudices loaded with something we don't care.
24:32
So intimately, this makes it pretty easy here, this boolean equation on the clock for the memory to register equals function.
24:42
Sorry, fetch one or executed one or execute you. And that is this little gating circuit here, just an old gauge for these three billion variables.
24:51
And then, of course, locating circuit has discussed. Next up in line is are the memory data register.
25:01
We do exactly the same again for this one of the other ones to follow.
25:09
We're looking, we're looking through the tables we put together to define the instruction set.
25:13
And from the register transfers, if you find that memory data register is used, of course, and fetch too.
25:18
Yeah,
25:24
because we want to fetch the data there or in execute too if we have a load instruction or an execute three if you have a load in direct instruction.
25:24
So the memory data register as loaded and fed to is needed in cycle three by the call instructions, so we have to be careful.
25:36
We do care that is still correct in that case,
25:44
so we cannot omit and load here because we need it to be correct for other instructions and particularly in this case here, but only.
25:49
Load Indirect uses the memory data register after executed three, so we can skip and load indirect because we don't care if it's another one,
26:01
this one, so we can simplify a little bit at least and skip and load indirect here, but remained was fed to or executed load or executed.
26:10
Three. Now we look into the registers, the programmable ones are zero, two are six.
26:22
And we have the opcode, then the destination register and then the source register defined in our instruction template.
26:31
So the register that changes the destination register is recorded in iBooks 22 22 in the present design, but we left with 23 optionally and empty.
26:43
So if you expanded the design to include 16 registers,
26:55
then the 23 would also be used and the condition of the destination register should change is again going someplace or instructions set tables.
26:58
It should change and execute for. Or execute three, if you have a load or it's one.
27:09
Or execute two and give them a call or call indirect in brackets or an execute one and clear.
27:17
Note that we introduced further Boolean variables here to summarise shifts simply left,
27:25
right and rotate shifting, and one is all one register instructions.
27:31
Again, we do this quickly here now because it's always the same principle to go through the tables and look where these things happen.
27:38
But I highly encourage looking at the tables yourself and doing this as an exercise.
27:45
Then we have the programme, a registered clocks, which somebody use a decoder to determine which register receives the clock pulse.
27:53
So from the. Bits that define our destination register you to know which one should get the
28:02
clock signal because so far we're treating it as a destination registered only,
28:11
but now we need, of course, to know which one to give a crap outside of those seven.
28:16
We use a decoder here and we have all three inputs bits here and then the clock signals outputs.
28:20
For each individual, one's individual, one gated by an end gate for each of those was system clock named.
28:28
It was C or just so the destination or just a clock signal, which we just defined here.
28:38
So this here is not enough, we need to know which of the registers exactly to give the clock falling edge,
28:46
and for this, we have this team multiplex here at it and using them here to only give one of those.
28:57
A clock full image now, of course, we would need a four bit decoder, not a three, but one if we expanded the design to 16 registers.
29:05
So here we have Nova three and we would need to expand it by one more to four.
29:14
So we have the clock signals now we go to the shift of function, select bits.
29:22
So we are using a simple four function shift shifter.
29:27
If you remember, we said we don't need the more complex one any longer because we have no high precision with 32 bit words.
29:30
So we don't need these cumbersome carry arrangements any longer for enabling higher precision arithmetic.
29:37
We are well catered for with our four function shifter.
29:43
Now, in most cases where data is routed through the shifter, we will no action.
29:48
If you remember if you need to go via the register into the memory, for example.
29:51
So we choose that to be the default. So the two shift as election bids here default zero zero is no action.
29:56
And then we simply specify a shift left right and rotate right.
30:04
With the other combinations remaining from the above table, we can easily determine the equations for the function.
30:08
Select bits if four equals arithmetic, shift, write or rotate.
30:14
This is simply the two once you, of course, and if three resembles, of course as [INAUDIBLE] or rotate right, which is the two one here.
30:20
Very similar you function select.
30:35
Now we have eight different options, as you do three bits, one remains on use default as the function zero and then we simply.
30:38
Give it a B minus A. A. B. A plus b exclusive or B A or B A and B and minus one note that we don't need B minus any longer because no,
30:50
we not only have a and B as registers, but we have these programmable registers and is good enough to have on this beano.
31:03
No. For this reason, this we can. Simply use the correct source and destination registers, we don't need both combinations here.
31:11
So we're simply signing here the default to be zero and assign some combination
31:23
here otherwise and go through these here to come up with these conditions.
31:28
What is, however, to be remarked, is that we say already when this is happening and.
31:35
A-minus is always happening and execute three.
31:43
In the case that we have subtract or compare a plus b again going through the tables, it's happening in three four decrement increments or at.
31:48
Exclusive will be for execution phase three and compare it will be executed three and four and be executed
31:59
three and end and finally minus one of the functions used to execute to in the case of decrement or compare.
32:07
So with this, we can directly write the function.
32:16
Boolean equations with the execute and command variables.
32:22
Now, let's look at the carry in bit.
32:33
The only place that one carries required in the current instruction set is if you want to increment and that is happening and execute three.
32:35
The default for the Korean bit will be zero and thus we can simply say.
32:43
Function five, the Korean bit is increment and three as the three, four, two zero, and that's the only condition where it is one.
32:49
It's a very simple. Note that we connected the Kerry output as an input to the controller.
32:56
We need to use it in our state sequencing logic for implementing skipped positive and negative instructions.
33:05
So if then kind of skip conditions first, doing some comparison to trigger the carrier and then skip on conditionally?
33:11
Now, the selection inputs are defined by the following three tables for the multiplexes.
33:28
Again, we go through the tables, look at the path and then we see. When this will be happening, so we need to.
33:36
See which register we're selecting or the bus and which path we're using your shift to a new programme, quantum models can be all right.
33:50
And finally, for us or incremental. So those are our selection bits.
34:00
Zero as one, as two, as four, as five to six and three, and it's critical once again back to the.
34:09
Layered. Mm-Hmm. So this is the multiplex here selection zero one two to select which register we choose.
34:17
Then we have these multiplexes here for the past year from a memory day to register with or without malls,
34:27
or from a view or from the shift or from the programme counter.
34:36
And that was selection three for the multiplex of whether we should take the programme
34:43
counter from this pause on dialect directory writing and to it or from the incremento.
34:49
So I'm skipping. So this is basically the selection that's we're talking about now.
35:00
And this is simply how we assign the different combinations.
35:11
The assignment basically two to choose. The right register pass.
35:15
So it's all possible. Now we go through the three things.
35:22
First thing is look at the registered transfer tables to determine when the different policies are selected.
35:31
And if you use, for example, select programme counter to mean the condition when the programme comes selected,
35:36
you find the programme contents selected and execute to.
35:41
If we have call or call indirect. The €L selected in execute one, if you have clear or in execute two or executed three,
35:46
if you have increment decrement or compare or and execute two three,
35:58
if you have to wear two of the Boolean variable, which becomes one,
36:03
would have to register the instructions being executed to another substitution of string.
36:07
If you wish to select, the pathway of the mask happens if you're an execute one and we have load or jumbo store.
36:11
If you remember those were the load store and jump direct instructions and they needed to go via the mosque to mosque the top, it's and executed one.
36:19
The mosque is also needed in exit three.
36:31
If you have called and the select memory data registers, a pass was needed and executed.
36:35
Three and the case of load or execute four.
36:40
So again, we're just going through the tables of the instructions that we defined.
36:43
Internal election bits as far as five and six, so using the unallocated selections as don't cares,
36:50
so these ones here we can simply replace by exes and don't care,
37:00
we simply get as four as equals, select a value or select and we are so basically where the select four is one in the table, that's the case for you.
37:06
We don't care here and MDR, and we don't care.
37:20
So this is how we come up with this. It's fine for equals select programme control, so it's fine if it's only one year where we care.
37:24
We do not care here or you're here. So that's fairly easy and same principle.
37:34
You're of course, a six. It's only one year for select models can select and be are we don't care here.
37:38
Registered selector,
37:50
we can find the conditions defining the register selected from the entries in the register transfer tables where A or B are loaded.
37:51
Sometimes the registered to be selected is the source register, so it's 16 to 19.
37:58
If you remember, sometimes that is the destination register.
38:03
It's 22 23. That is sometimes funny, also the internal US.
38:07
And we're just going through the tables again, see that source register needs to be selected and exit one if you have indirect or to remember,
38:15
these were the variables indicating the instruction Typekit and should use earlier.
38:24
Select bus needs to be done in next year two and one and select just initial register and select source for select bus.
38:29
Not. The individual selection is again done by multiplex.
38:38
Well, actually, they're not again proves the you said you might have picked a nominee to the
38:45
multiplex with an additional set of gates to impose the select bus condition.
38:49
So we use the multiplex a, you know, to go from the instruction.
38:55
Register your.
38:59
Why are these gates to have to select so conditions are respected and to select us equal in each and one as another condition here with the OK?
39:03
So basically, we're just putting this into secretary you. Now, the programme counter is last but not least,
39:17
and we get the conditions for it to be connected to the internal buzz from the registered transfer tables, and that is very simple.
39:27
In fact, one or execute one if you have call or indirect.
39:34
So how did we do? We put together our 32 bit processor.
39:41
You could make your wiring list by the components and actually tested.
39:47
So the components might cost some 200 to 300 pounds more than twice the price
39:53
of an Intel Core to process about the time when we first took the lecture,
39:59
we can get much more powerful processors now for this money.
40:03
And the clock could be set about 10 kilohertz 10 kilo hertz, not megahertz.
40:08
So we could do it a bit faster if you fabricated it on a single chip rather than buying the components and putting it together.
40:15
But we very, very far from the speeds we're used to.
40:21
So it looks like we had better considered a Mach two version straight away before we would go to the market with this.
40:27
What could we do to improve it? Well, the instruction format. It's the first point you start from.
40:34
Instructions are all 32 bit, but mostly the buttons 16 bits are empty.
40:41
If remember, we had been quite wasteful of many times. Most, of course, in the case of an operation and other one operation.
40:45
So we only use a top aides and do not use to station or a memory address bits, but also in other cases where we only have one register.
40:54
Of course, we were quite wasteful. And even with two registers, we left a lot of empty 16 bits.
41:04
This means that we are wasting memory space because we're fetching all the time.
41:11
So the two bits as bytes, we're not using 32 bit,
41:16
so we're wasting memory space and we also do many more fetch cycles than we need because if we could somehow pack more into that,
41:19
we would need to fetch less. So we could pack up the instructions on byte boundaries rather than word boundaries.
41:28
So by boundaries, every eight bits rather than word boundaries because the instruction have one bite eight bits.
41:37
And introduce some multiplexing hardware to load the instruction register correctly, depending on the instruction.
41:44
We know how much will follow it and what will follow it, whether it's the next instruction or data like the address in the memory.
41:51
We could also do a lot of magic improvements, we have three unused inputs on the multiplex,
42:00
so if you remember the selected on bus and we could do additional arithmetic hardware such as the 16 bit multiplier,
42:04
multiply the bottom 16 bits of a B to obtain a 32 bit result.
42:11
We could also invest into an incremental or a decrement.
42:16
Then we could optimise the data, passes additional multiplexes could help us reduce instruction cycles of many of our instructions.
42:21
And just as an example, we could have an additional multiplex such as select B,
42:30
so the B register independently from the register, which would read as many as three final instructions to two cycles.
42:36
The whole idea is reduce the number of instructions.
42:44
Yeah, and then we need less clicks, takes off the clock and through faster and having be selectable independently from a get,
42:47
many of the three execute cycle instructions down to to a data pass from the
42:56
registers to the internal bus would also reduce some instructions by one cycle.
43:02
And this would require an additional input on the bus,
43:07
select a multiplex and so might be considered and now turn it off to the additional arithmetic functions already discussed.
43:10
So we come to those, potentially at the same time as our current design.
43:16
And of course, we could be working on the combinatorial circuits on the hardware level.
43:22
That is the hard part. We want to have the minimum time delays and a lot of combination of logic circuits.
43:26
And this is partly a question of past links,
43:33
but it does also require looking at low level transistor models to calculate the time accurately and not running to raise hazards.
43:36
And that is the end of the course, we put together our 32 bit processor, and we discuss also to improve it,
43:44
and I hope you have a good appetite for computer architecture and other
43:53
lectures to follow where you will be learning much more how to improve on this.
43:58
But isn't it great? We really know what's under the hood of a conventional microprocessor from gate level upwards.
44:02
Well, it's not really the end of the course coursework to take the place of the first lap exercise of next term,
44:10
and you can do it as soon as you like, the instruction sheets will be on the course website or already.
44:16
There will be a revision session before the exam of the start of the summer term.
44:23
And please watch the court's website for the time and venue of this revision session.
44:27
And in the meantime, have a great break. Thank you very, very much for your interest in this course and hope you really enjoyed it.
