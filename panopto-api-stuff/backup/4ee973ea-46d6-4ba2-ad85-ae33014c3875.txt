Title: Lecture 6: Computer Architecture
Category: COMP40005 - Introduction to Computer Architecture (Spring 2021-2022)
Lecturer: Wayne Luk
Date: 31/01/2022
Let's get to the probably the most important part of the architecture,
0:00
which is the data path, which obviously include the ACLU and other registers and so on.
0:07
And what's more importantly, how to make the data path.
0:15
Useful in processing instructions. OK.
0:23
OK, so we'll just start by the observation, which was published in an article a few years ago showing that the architecture is adopted by over.
0:27
Well, they say that 99 percent of the process in what is now the post-PC era.
0:42
OK. I think the exact numbers are not so important,
0:50
but just to recognise that what you're learning now really covered the principles of the majority of today's processes.
0:55
So we adopt the same approach as we did previously, which is to start by something very simple and then gradually make it more complex.
1:06
OK, well, let me try to understand data path.
1:20
How can we do that? So what we'll do will adopt a three step strategy.
1:24
We all know three, a lucky number. So the first step is we'll try to find the simplest possible data path for each type of instruction.
1:32
So in other words, we have the simplest data path customise just for the all time instructions.
1:45
And then we have the data portal for a time. And then we have the data path for each type of branch instructions and so on.
1:53
OK. So because the architecture is designed just for the data, just for that instruction type, it has to be very simple and easy to understand.
2:03
OK, now, of course, if we have all these separate data paths, then it might not actually be very useful.
2:16
So what we need to do because in practise the data path need to support multiple types of instruction.
2:26
So once we have this separate data path, we need to find a way to combine them.
2:34
OK. And the way to combine them. Well, as you could imagine, is really to put in this control elements, which typically consists of if then else.
2:40
In a block. And of course, we know that these so-called multiplexes.
2:57
OK. And what we'll do, we'll just put in the.
3:03
We just identified the places that we would put the multiplexes in.
3:10
OK, but let's not worry about how to control them.
3:15
OK, because we know that. But we have a multiplex.
3:20
We do need to worry about how to control the multiplex to select either the true input or the false input.
3:24
But let's not worry about that. The second step, the second step. We just identify the places where we will put these control elements.
3:34
OK, so we need to provide the multiplexes in this combined data path.
3:44
If you look at the diagram, you can see that the middle diagram is already a little bit more complex than the top one.
3:52
Now, the top one is easy because you only need to support one type of instruction the middle bit.
4:02
Well, it could support multiple types of instruction. OK, so you've got these two elements there, but it does not say how to generate.
4:08
They control signals that would control the multiplexes.
4:21
So that would be tougher in the final step. By looking at the control unit, so you could see that the bottom diagram.
4:25
Is even more complicated. Well, because it now has the green bloc, which is the control unit in that.
4:36
OK, so we need to figure out well in 45 minutes time what the green box will do in order to produce the controlled signals for the multiplexes.
4:45
And the whole point is what is more complex data path at the bottom that would
4:58
behave like the top data path where we are dealing with out instructions.
5:04
OK. So let me put in the right control signals.
5:12
Then the bottom complex data path will actually behave like the simple data path that we derive at the very beginning.
5:18
OK, so that's the reason why we started up something simple.
5:30
And then we gradually make it more complex. And in this case,
5:35
the simple version at the beginning will provide us the reference that we could check that the more
5:39
complex data path at the bottom would actually behave like the very simple one that we start with.
5:46
OK. So let us go right in and see the first architecture for the outside instruction.
5:55
OK, well, remember to say of the instruction for the old type.
6:03
OK, so obviously we have the opcode and then we have to source food that correspond to the two
6:08
source registers because our type instructions usually dealing with arithmetic with two inputs,
6:15
though the sole source registers correspond to providing the values for the binary operation,
6:24
and the results of that operation would then be stored in the register specified by the destination field.
6:32
OK. And if you are Schifrin's Russian, then that's also a failed to specify how much we shift and we to worry about that for now.
6:41
And then in the final six bit, there is something called the function code,
6:52
which can be used to specify additional information for which operation of arithmetic that we want to carry out.
6:58
So if we want to carry out an addition or subtraction path usually specified by the function code, the last bits of that instruction?
7:12
OK, but don't worry about the function code for now. If you just look at the example of what we want to do is to take the value in
7:23
Rochester six and rest of the seven atom together for the result to register five.
7:37
OK. And you could see from that diagram the architecture, the data path to do that.
7:42
OK, well, you could see that is really it's very simple because it take the two values from the rest of the file.
7:52
OK. So we look at the instruction to specify source one.
8:01
OK. And in that case, it is six and register six would then come out from the first output.
8:09
First, with data on that.
8:21
And similarly, the register, too is the input the specify which register would be used for the second upper end of this operation.
8:24
And from the instruction is to the source to value, which specify the second register, which in this case is such as the seventh and the data.
8:42
Two output would provide the value of register seven.
8:57
And that would go to the ALU. And do not forget that we need to provide the controls that allow you to say that look, that is not in addition, OK?
9:02
So don't do subtraction, don't do and so forth and so on to an addition.
9:15
And then the result will then be written back to the register.
9:21
And which registered well, if specified by the test, the nation failed on the day of the instruction.
9:29
OK. And in this case is which of the five? All right.
9:35
So I hope this is simple enough that this is the simplest description of how the data path for the old time instruction.
9:39
OK. So if you look at something slightly more complex, which is the eye type, so let's look at the low instruction.
9:49
Well, in this case, what we want to do is to obtain a value from the memory into one of the registers.
10:01
OK, so the immediate question that you would ask is, well, where in the memory and where in the register?
10:10
OK, because we have 30 to register. So which one do we want to load the value from the memory into?
10:19
All right. So we need to figure out where in the memory and which register.
10:28
Involved in this operation. So in order to figure out where the memory is, so we need to compute the address of the memory.
10:36
And as you may remember from the previous lecture, the address of the memory is a combination of both the offset fields.
10:45
Obtained from the least six significant 16 bits of the instruction.
10:58
OK, so from the instruction, we take the offset to the list that is going 16 bit.
11:05
OK, and then we want to add.
11:11
To add that the value of the source register.
11:17
So also on the instruction, the source switches, the value from the instruction is read into the rest of the file,
11:24
which would produce from the Theta one output of the richest file.
11:31
In this particular case, it is the value store in Rochester.
11:38
Six. OK. So we want to add the value from Rochester six to the offset of the instruction.
11:44
OK, now, but we know Offset is only 16 bits in order to make sure the two value we are adding.
11:56
Would both be 32 bits? We need to sign extend the value of the offsets.
12:04
OK, so the now both value. Going to the inputs of the l.u of all 32 bits, and again, we told you that it's an instruction,
12:12
we now get the summation of registered sex and the offset, which is now the address, and that address would then be supplied to the data memory.
12:25
So we are separating the data memory from the instruction memory so we could see
12:35
that in a minute and the result would then be written back to the register,
12:41
specify by the destination feel of the instruction.
12:47
OK, so. I hope you would all agree that this is an obvious implementation.
12:53
Off the data path to carry out the memory access load instruction.
13:03
Now, of course, this is slow. Yes. Otherwise, the six. So.
13:10
So. So the specification.
13:22
Of how the law works is to combine Offset if the various stories of particular register.
13:28
OK, so in this case, the source field of the instruction is six, which means that it is the value stored in Richard's a six,
13:34
combined with the offset to form the address, the fact that the previously voted for the same split.
13:48
Yes, that's right. So we assume that the appeal, the value is you read to the six.
13:56
Yeah. OK. Well, OK, so now if you go to low than we should be able to store as well and store is pretty much the same.
14:01
But we do need to add two things. The first is that the destination?
14:12
Is now a the field is now part of the second input to the riches of.
14:21
OK, because we want to store the value.
14:31
Into the memory, OK, so we now use the output, which is with data to from the rest of the file, which is the value in Russia so far.
14:42
And use it to write to the data memory.
14:56
OK, so we need that blue line on the right in order to effect this right of the value into the data memory.
15:01
OK, so if we are to these two connexions, then the data path can do both load and stole.
15:14
OK, so now this is if you like our first combination, then we could now combine that.
15:24
With the old type in the beginning by, well, we now need to add to multiplexes.
15:32
So the first one is before the second input of the ale you.
15:43
OK. Because the output of the second.
15:49
Output of the rest of the file can either go to the ALU for the all time construction, or it could go into the right data for the store inspection.
15:56
OK. And that multiplex, though, could be used to decide what the input to the is the second input to the ALU,
16:09
so it could either be the all type instruction or it could be use in the low instruction two to compute the memory address.
16:22
OK. And then the other the other multiplex is to select whether the right data of the richest of all.
16:37
Is from the ACLU, in the case of all time instruction, or if we want to load the value into the riches of out,
16:51
then the the input to the right data would be from the memory.
17:01
OK, so you could see that by adding this to multiplexes,
17:09
then this architecture could be used to support both the all time construction and the load and the store instruction.
17:15
OK, now obviously this is more complicated,
17:24
but if you look at the highlighted Blue Connexions and you could compare that with the original data path for just the outside,
17:26
which are replicated on the top right over there.
17:38
OK, if you compare the effect blue lines with the connexion of the data path just for the outcome, you'll see that they're are excited to say.
17:42
OK, so you could say that as long as we have the multiple access control to the right connexions like this,
17:53
then this more complex version correspond exactly to the beta path or the outside.
18:03
OK. And obviously you could check that well if we have different control to the multiplexes,
18:10
then in this case it would correspond to the load instruction and so on.
18:18
OK. So you could compare in this diagram the bottom telegram, the highlighted connexion.
18:25
Is exactly the same as the architecture or the data, the path just for the low infection.
18:35
OK. So that would be straightforward.
18:45
And then we could do exactly the same for the branch instruction.
18:49
In this case, we look at two registers, five and six.
18:55
OK. And we could compare them by doing a subtract subtraction and then if the result is zero.
19:02
So remember, in the earlier lecture, we explain how the AL you could produce an output to show whether we saw with zero or not.
19:14
And if it's zero, then we could get a bronze value to the next instruction, which is the instruction from the pilgrim counter.
19:27
OK, so you can see there is an additional eather at the top to two?
19:42
Well, the next instruction you use should be. OK.
19:48
Two apparent value computed well obtained from the offset.
19:53
OK, now you might say, well, OK, we should add to the offset, but why do we need to shift it by two?
20:01
OK. Well, the answer is because an instruction is funny to bits.
20:10
Which correspond to four points. OK, so.
20:17
The offset correspond to how many instructions bothered, how many bites.
20:24
But we add the things, we're adding the number of bites, so therefore we need to multiply the number of infections by four.
20:29
So the number of points that should then be added to the instruction at the top.
20:38
OK, now that would become clearer when I showed the rest of the data OK,
20:45
because this data pass doesn't show the instruction memory and so on, which would show that.
20:51
OK. So this is now the combined data of the.
21:00
We could use to process the branch instruction.
21:08
The low end store and the old type. OK.
21:13
We don't have the instruction memo yet, and that will be so later on.
21:18
But the the red blocks correspond to the main control elements that will need some control input.
21:23
OK. So for example, the register, we need control to specify whether it's reading or writing.
21:35
Obviously, we need control to the multiplexes. And so the data memory, we also need to specify whether it's reading or writing.
21:41
OK, so now let's do the next step. OK, so we know at the rest of the day the path and see what is happening there.
21:50
So now you could see that we have the instruction memory that so that correspond to the memory that provides instructions.
22:04
OK? And the output of the instruction memory is 32 bits which go which correspond to the
22:15
32 bits of instruction and the corresponding fields are connected to the registers.
22:26
And so. OK. And then if we look to the right, to the left, you'll see the input to the instruction memory.
22:35
And we all know that this is the programme counter which would compute the value of the next instruction.
22:47
OK. So it tells the instruction memory, the address of the next instruction so that that could then be called use to that data path.
22:59
OK. Yes, we. Oh, you mean the shift left over?
23:12
Yeah. So each instruction is thirty two bits. Right?
23:20
And that calls on the four points. OK, but when we add things, we're editing in pipes, not instruction.
23:25
Yeah. So therefore, let's say if the offset is free, that means you should offset by free instruction.
23:34
Each instruction goes four points, so we need to modify the three by four.
23:44
But multiply by four, correspond the shifting to. All right.
23:50
OK, now, and actually the same is the case for the programme counter, you'll see that we're adding four to it.
23:55
And why do we at four? Well, again, because each instruction got four points.
24:09
OK. And that's why the programme purposeful correspond to the address of the next instruction.
24:14
And then. You go to the pit at the top.
24:23
You'll see that that provides the input to the other.
24:28
Which has a multiplex on the right of the other.
24:34
So depending on whether it is processing a branch instruction or not, if it does, then you do the addition.
24:38
You do not. If it is in the branch instruction, then you skip that using the multiplex.
24:49
OK, so so that would be the if you like the combined data path where we include the instruction in there as well.
24:55
OK, so no less. Yes.
25:08
Explain why we asked for it. Oh, well, we had fog. OK, well, remember each insertion is four point twenty two bits.
25:13
OK, so but when we add things, it is adding on a plate basis.
25:24
OK, so if it at full price, that is 32 bits that correspond to each instruction.
25:30
You're happy with that. OK. OK. So. Let us first quickly check back.
25:37
When we have the control elements, all point, all set appropriately as we corresponding to the highlighted Blue Connexions on this diagram, OK?
25:45
You'll see that it is exactly the same as the all time data path at the bottom left corner.
26:03
OK. So in other words, as long as you have the multiplexes, let's say the multiplex there of the second input value when it connect to the sero input.
26:14
And the multiplex, let's say, at the very bottom bottom right,
26:29
connect also to the zero input of the multiplex that correspond exactly to the data path just for the time.
26:36
OK, so what is more complex looking architecture?
26:48
Well, actually, it's really just behaving like the altitude above.
26:52
Now the only other thing is the one at the top. Well, that's pretty obvious because we are not we are not doing a broad instruction.
26:59
Therefore, we just skip the addition on the right, which is at full, which correspond to finding the address of the next instruction.
27:06
OK. All right. So that is out. And and we could do the same and check for the low instruction.
27:17
OK. So on this diagram, to highlight the blue lines corresponds to setting the multiplexes and so on to the right places so that.
27:29
The connected plot correspond exactly to the data path for this low instruction on the bottom left corner.
27:45
OK, so you could tell it carefully. Well, it's really exactly the same.
27:55
OK. And similarly, you could do the same for the bronze instruction.
28:01
OK, so, so the again, I highlighted the Connexions, which correspond to the branch data path, as you could see on the bottom bit.
28:08
OK. All right, so well, we're almost there, but then.
28:22
There are various control signals that we need to worry about.
28:29
OK, so this will light the bronze data path.
28:34
But this is conditional on we are providing the right control stick those with the multiplexes and so on.
28:39
OK, now actually, the multiplex is probably the easy part.
28:47
There is one block which haven't told you before that that we also need to pay attention to, and that is the control of the ALU.
28:52
OK. So you see the bottom input? Well, not the calculation input, but there is a control input of the value call and you control.
29:04
So how can we generate that as well?
29:17
OK, so let's look at how you control. So in other words, we need a plot.
29:21
Call your control. OK. The output of which goes into this.
29:29
OK, so what is the input to that?
29:37
Is a block at the top over there? OK.
29:41
And what does this block take? Well, it's actually inputs.
29:46
It takes the function code, which is the bottom six bits of an all type instruction and also two bits.
29:50
Which is from the control unit that we're going to talk about later.
30:00
OK, so we take this to input to the air you control block, and the output of this block would be the air you control, input to the ale you.
30:07
OK, now, if we specify if we look at a truth table of this particular AQ control block, well, what what does it contain?
30:19
Well, I mentioned that it should take two bits of the control unit.
30:31
OK. And that was specify the instruction type, and then it should also take six bits from the function code.
30:38
OK. And that will specify whether it is an addition and subtraction and an OR.
30:51
And so.
30:58
OK, so if we have these two inputs, then the output of this plot should be the appropriate control signals to the ACLU to tell that it should perform,
31:00
it adds or offset or less set on less than as you could see in your lecture.
31:17
OK, so that would be the output to the right of this table, and the two inputs are specified in the first two columns of this table.
31:26
Everybody happy with that. OK, so we need to combine these values in order to separate.
31:39
Now you should do and now should do so now you should do settle less than.
31:48
OK, so these three bits the. Given by the earlier lecture, which now obviously from the output of this particular plot, the.
31:52
So is six minutes from the function call, maybe.
32:08
Few oh, these are two bits. OK.
32:13
I feel sorry for the sick business.
32:18
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. Well, it only took a subset of it doesn't need to take all the bits.
32:23
OK, so that would become obvious later on.
32:31
So. It's really the OpCo provides go into a control unit that produces to stupid for the aliens.
32:38
OK, so he's not directly affected to bits will become obvious a bit later on.
32:48
OK. So if you want to optimise this, you OK?
32:53
Does something, if you're interested is a method called came up or carnal maps that you could look at each bit of the output.
33:01
OK, now a slightly confusing because the output of this block is you control input.
33:17
OK, so the right most column you control input is the output of this block.
33:24
OK. So we could devise and optimise a large equation for each of the three bits.
33:32
Of this output, which is called Hélio Control Input. OK.
33:43
And you could just. Look at the input for each of the values in this column, and you could see that each of the input is called FCO,
33:49
F1, F2 f3 because F4 an EF five if you don't test, so we don't need to worry about them.
34:06
And we could have a table like this. If you are familiar with that, then hopefully you could follow what I said.
34:12
If you are not familiar with this case, maps, do not worry.
34:20
OK, so. The equation, as long as you understand the table that that is good enough.
34:24
You don't need to worry how you could optimise that.
34:30
So once we've got this table, then we know what the right outfit should be for given input.
34:36
OK. And that's all we want to worry about.
34:46
OK, so. As a result of what we describe, we are just covering this red ellipse block at the bottom of the target volume control.
34:52
OK, so you control, as I explained previously, that it takes the function code input, the six split from the left, and then it takes two bits.
35:07
€L. And there you rob. Is derive from the control unit, which have been put in there yet.
35:21
OK. So this diagram summarises the control to this plot.
35:29
So we need to Air Europe, which is a two bit input to the air you control over that.
35:38
And then we also have four multiplexes rep desk, which is the one over there and you source which is the one before the second input of the ale.
35:46
You are to correspond to the multiplex at the output of the data memory and sort.
36:02
OK, so we need to set those for this for multiplexes, and then we also meet the value for the storage.
36:13
Well, we have two storage which need control signals.
36:29
One is the richest the file, so we have to register right control.
36:35
And then for data memory, we have to control one is memory right?
36:43
And the other one is that we read. OK, so well, this does correspond to the to the pulps specified in this particular MIPS, this website.
36:50
And also remember that. When we process instruction, as I'll show in a minute, all this would take place within a single cycle.
37:05
OK, before that, we'll just look at the summary of all the controls.
37:15
It knows that I've shown over here, so I'm not going to describe each individually because, well, that is something that I just mentioned.
37:20
OK, so this just describes the controls in slightly more detail.
37:29
But the key thing is, well, now that we know the control signals, we could double check that it is still behaving the same or not.
37:36
OK, so once we got the instruction memory, it goes into the registers and then the register would produce the values.
37:48
When we are dealing with the outcome,
38:01
instructions will produce the two values for the ALU and then the result in the ALU would just be sort of back to the register.
38:02
OK. So again. All this, although I sort of saw it step by step.
38:12
What I just described, we will complete within one clock cycle.
38:20
OK. And you could see the the highlight of Blue Connexions are exactly the same as the,
38:25
well, the simple data path for the all time show in the very beginning.
38:34
OK, so we had all these things, but when we processed the all time instruction, well, it really behaves like this, as you could see from there.
38:40
OK. And then we could do the same for the low instruction.
38:50
You could see step by step from the instruction.
38:55
We go to the rest of the file and then the output reaches a file.
38:59
How we would then be combined with the offset, which is then saying extend it,
39:04
add to the ALU to provide the address to the data memory and the output of the data memory,
39:10
but would then be stored in the corresponding register specified by the destination few of the load instruction.
39:18
OK, now again,
39:30
you could check that the highlighted Connexions correspond exactly to the data path for the low instruction shown at the bottom left of this diagram.
39:31
OK. And similarly, we would track the same for the branch instruction either.
39:44
OK. OK, so now let's get to the last part of the data path, which is, well,
39:51
we have this thing called control unit, which will generate the control signals.
40:03
Well, how does that work? OK. Well, because everything just takes place within one clock cycle.
40:09
This control unit will simply be a combination of logic, though there's no registry in there.
40:16
You provide the input, which in this case would be the opcode of each instruction.
40:23
OK, so the input to this control unit is the six bit of code.
40:32
And then there are nine bits control controlling the multiplex, the ALU and also the read and write and so on.
40:39
OK, now you come along. Why is that?
40:49
No, OK? Well, because they are full multiplexes, each of which would require one control signal.
40:52
And then we also have these three controls Tecno's one for the rest of the file and two for the data memory.
41:00
OK. And then we also have the control to the €L.
41:12
And do not forget the air you're up. Control has two bits.
41:16
OK. So when you add all this together, there's a total of nine control signals for this data.
41:21
OK. OK, so now you can see this is the most complex version of the data path that it really include everything, including the kitchen sink.
41:30
OK. And you can see that, well, what is this so complicated?
41:46
Well, because I make the control unit explicit.
41:50
In this diagram, so we could see the elliptical shape control unit at the top there,
41:55
and it contains nine outputs which correspond to the control signals.
42:01
I don't draw the connexion from the control unit to the, for example,
42:08
to the l.u control or to the multiplexes because it really will clutter the diagram.
42:16
OK. But, you know, if you want to show something impressive to your grandparents or to some student in mechanical engineering,
42:23
well connected with the connexion as well as they oh wow, how complicated it is.
42:33
Say, Well, this is what you learn in the architecture class. OK, so well, let's look.
42:38
If we need to deal with the low instruction, what would happen? OK, well, what would happen is that, well, it's pretty much the same as before.
42:46
The main difference, though, is that when we cut the value from the instruction memory,
42:55
the UBCO will also go in the control unit, as you can see from the top.
43:02
OK. And then the control unit think, no,
43:08
we will make sure that the multiplexes and the registers and so on will have
43:14
the appropriate control signals so they're able to behave as one would expect.
43:21
So you could see that the highlighted Connexions Blue Connexions corresponds exactly to the data path.
43:27
Designed just for the low infection at the bottom left.
43:40
OK. They say exactly the same. So all this complexity of only a control unit and so on.
43:45
Well, they are really just to make sure that this combined data,
43:52
which looks complicated when it is dealing with the low instruction, it would behave exactly the same as this one.
43:57
So that is the secret. OK, so this is the three step.
44:05
Approach to understand the status of.
44:14
And once you understand that, well, hopefully you could deal with more complex architectures and you could adopt the same idea,
44:18
the frame three steps might be a bit more because obviously this is a simplified
44:29
version of the data path and we're only dealing with the main types of instructions.
44:36
And there are many things that we have no.
44:45
In this description, but the spirit is very much similar when you're dealing with more complex architecture.
44:49
Could we start with the simplest possible data path just for a particular type of instruction and we could gradually combine them together?
44:58
Look at a control that knows how to transmit the controls signals.
45:10
Can we check that the more complex data path complying with the appropriate controls most will give us back the.
45:14
Simple data path for a particular type of instruction, so we could actually check the correctness of your complex data path when given the
45:25
right control signals could give give us back the simple data of just the process.
45:34
That particular type of instruction. OK, so see you on first thing.
45:43
