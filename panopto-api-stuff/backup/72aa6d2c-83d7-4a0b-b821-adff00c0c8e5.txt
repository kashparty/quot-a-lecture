Title: Ethics Q&A - 15 December 2021
Category: Ethics
Lecturer: Thomas Lancaster
Date: 15/12/2021
So how do you get everyone up to Wednesday, 15th of December, midpoint of our week,
0:02
although not quite at the midpoint, if you're working on your ethics assignment?
0:10
We've got the, I think, the best dressed lecturer in the UK with us as usual.
0:14
We've got Blake here, sir. Sir, hi, play well. You just carry off these outfits with such style as I can never surpass that.
0:19
It's either you or my friend, my friend Suleiman Turkey, who is a bit of a coup in the academic integrity world.
0:29
And between you, you are very much a tie. Well, you're very kind.
0:35
This one. A song by Johnny Cash that covers it.
0:42
While I'm pretty of a different Johnny Cash song, so I won't go that far. But apart from that, yes.
0:47
And so thanks everyone for joining us.
0:53
Just let's do a quick recap of where we're at. For the benefit of people here in the video.
0:56
So yesterday we had the, I think, very useful session. We brought Harmony Centre for academic English.
1:02
If you missed that one than it is on the blackboard site,
1:07
it isn't up on Panopto because of the system centre academic and is used to do have a look there.
1:11
If you want to review any of the the materials and sort of remind ourselves of the process we're going through is on Friday,
1:16
we would like you to hand in a a clear video about the ethics project,
1:27
the ethics of that you're working on, that you've completed as part of your team.
1:33
And really, we'd like to see some coherence throughout that video.
1:38
So what would be ideal would be not for you to just say there were four of us we will do.
1:42
We'll split into four bits and we will never talk to one another and we'll hand something in
1:48
at the end because those videos just don't have a great deal of flow and don't make sense.
1:51
So you do need to try and discuss things a bit more than that, and also to all ideally review the video at the end.
1:57
Before you hand it in check, you're all happy with it. So there is a bit of time involved there and it's up to you.
2:04
How are you going to do this? But that is is my recommendation then and I thought my funny brother in these videos, it does.
2:10
And just in general is that rather than saying we will do four minutes, each person one does four minutes, person two to four minutes,
2:19
etc. and you cut in and out between different people maybe even have a conversation between people on the video.
2:26
It flows much nicer. The question is just a group leader that hands it a slice of video or team members.
2:31
Henderson. So it's a group leader will be the person who uploads this to Kate.
2:38
But then on Kate, there is a button. Everyone clicks to say, We agree this submission.
2:44
We have worked as a team, so you all have to go through and click that button as well for that one.
2:48
But we only need uploading once because it's a bit pointless to have separate
2:53
uploads for that and that that synchronises with a system that uses to go
2:56
in a system and I used to I tend to watch some of them know all of them because
3:01
there aren't always enough hours in the day to check everyone lectures. And I would like to for that.
3:06
Just too many conflicting tasks that they that are going on there.
3:11
But we will. We all get there as we always do.
3:16
And then the other big hand in this is a bit that confused people, I think slightly yesterday is a bit with Bret.
3:20
That is the one page summary. So we're saying 250 to 300 words, it should all fit on one page.
3:25
You kind of have some additional words to put your references in and they can go on to another page if you need to.
3:34
But we want the main content on one page, so it's quite short in terms of the length of this, then the detail is going to be in the video.
3:39
The detail of the ethical case is the processes. The the summary is exactly what it says.
3:50
It is a summary and I was thinking I I did an interview recently for as in a media type interview, which is going online sometime this week.
3:55
And we spoke for about half an hour and they sent me the transcript to check for.
4:07
This is about 5000 words, and this was not me talking particularly fast, sad to actually pause for thought about some of these things and everything.
4:11
So you think how much in a quite a fast moving presentation, you can easily cover two thousand words, maybe 3000 words in 15 minutes.
4:23
If you're talking quite quickly and editing that, I mean,
4:32
I can tell it very quickly and go through a lot of content and not make a lot of sense and rumble. And I have done that on occasion.
4:36
But these are the things you can do. And the other thing people doing presentations which actually could increase the word
4:41
count is that you can have separate words on the slide compared to the ones you're saying.
4:48
So you can have additional detail on the slide or things you don't go through in great depth.
4:53
So it would add to what you're saying. So really, you take a presentation and you try and transcribe.
4:57
And the detail you can get a lot more than a number of words.
5:02
Yes, you're trying to take that down to 250 to 300 words got to be very tight, very on point, very selective for that one.
5:05
Another question, very useful one here would just on that previous topic.
5:16
This is why as well, you will probably. Yeah, you need to plan out now.
5:21
Please do believe you have to plan out the presentation and make sure you at least know
5:26
what the structure of the presentation is before you try and start writing the summary,
5:30
because otherwise they won't match and they won't make sense.
5:35
And as we said yesterday, it is a summary of the work of the group as a whole, not your individual section of work.
5:38
So the question what if you have a really recent incident and there aren't any academic papers on it yet?
5:44
So I believe it's going to put some notice in the chart. I will add to that while we think about this one as well.
5:50
Well, I mean, I can say the vast majority of ethical incidents,
5:56
nobody will ever write them up in the form of academic paper because that is not what academic papers generally are for.
6:00
So not covering one incident in detail in the same way you will. So you have to think around that.
6:06
Some press reports in The Guardian or whatever, as Blair mentioned, that might just be my first choice.
6:13
You look at the press, you might look at things like social media nowadays is a great influence point to people's reactions to a particular situation,
6:19
and things like tweets are really useful.
6:28
I use them in talks because they give you a very succinct answer that will fit nicely on a slide about somebody a different viewpoint for that one.
6:31
But you might also look into a slightly, but you might generalise your question as well for that one.
6:41
So you're looking at a very recent example, but actually there was a similar case five years ago,
6:48
which you can say, well, in the more general situation, this is what happened.
6:56
This is what people have written about it. So how come this happened for a second time?
7:00
So a company has been hacked before? How how did this happen again or related area in your field so you can bring those ideas,
7:04
but we don't necessary explain everything just based on academic papers.
7:11
This is one of the skills you develop as you go through your life with academic life is working out what is relevant and it will be the same.
7:15
I mean, this question before this year's third and fourth, considering individual projects right now, this question came up.
7:24
I, I manage that process as well there. How did you learn about a really new topic?
7:29
Because a lot of the research topics people are doing are based on cutting edge research being conducted by Stanford
7:35
Imperial and therefore has not got a published textbook about let me could go and learn from or something like that.
7:42
So you have to find what is relevant, and it might sometimes be the recent papers that aren't accessible.
7:50
It might be a video of somebody stole the game because quite often talks are more accessible than the printed resources there.
7:57
So see what is out there, and not all reports are equal another place as well.
8:06
Sometimes you find good materials in somebody's dissertation, a Ph.D. dissertation, a recent Masters dissertation.
8:11
A lot of them are online now or even a recent undergraduate dissertation for that.
8:17
Should the PowerPoints have more or less detail than the scripts for the video?
8:23
That is an interesting question. And first point I'll pick up is you don't necessarily need a complete script.
8:29
That one is up to you. You may just sketch out the points you want to make and talk around them so long as you if you have a script,
8:38
just try and make it look like you're not reading a script. That is my only recommendation there.
8:46
How much detail you have? Well, you're going to see more and when you speak because you speak fast in general,
8:52
then you go to right on the slides because you're doing online slide.
9:00
You only have so much screen real estate, so your slides, they outline, the talk adds to it.
9:04
But one trick I use quite often is I may have a bit of information on the slides I don't directly speak about or read out,
9:11
but people will just see going on in the background there.
9:20
So it may be almost subliminal that this happens.
9:24
People look at this. Another thing people do quite often is they have a nice visual presentation,
9:28
so you have a picture on there and that is the focus of what you're talking about, but you don't need to write.
9:35
I would put a few words on the pictures just because I have this view that it's nice if things work.
9:42
If people just look at your slides, at least get a flavour about what things are about.
9:47
But you will see these these presentations, which are purely people just do 10 slides,
9:52
10 images, and that is a presentation because the presentation is in the speech.
9:57
Different views about that one. What makes a good PowerPoint presentation that that is such an open question,
10:02
you can find people selling these guides online about this, and they all have their own opinions.
10:12
So I think a good PowerPoint presentation is that it doesn't look like one of the templates you get inside Microsoft Office.
10:16
That's one of my preferred things there.
10:23
I think the presentation and the the speech should match up nicely and they should complement each other,
10:27
but they shouldn't necessarily repeat each part.
10:35
I think they have to be ways to draw people in very early on, as I've said before, because people turn off in boring talks incredibly early.
10:39
So that one part, I think it's nice to have a variety of design styles in a presentation.
10:48
There's a bit of consistency in terms of the overall layout,
10:54
but you don't just want every slide being a lot of bullet points or every slide being essentially the same for that either.
10:57
So means there's no shortage of things I have.
11:07
If if, for instance, you're going to find my slide share account and look at the kind of talks I do externally,
11:11
you'll see I have quite a variety of slide types I use,
11:19
and some of this depends about how much time I have and how much effort I have to put in and how important I consider this to be.
11:22
The other bits of your presentation to think about is a video, rather than a live presentation you can edit.
11:31
You can be slightly more creative than if you just had a slide deck of 20 slides you're going to talk through.
11:38
So you can, in theory, add in short video clips. You can add in a discussion or you can add in a short film segment to somebody.
11:44
If you want to experiment around, you can experiment with green screens like I've got behind me.
11:53
There are all kinds of different things you can do there. But that one is is really up to do.
11:57
Yeah. Columbia are great examples, and Blair, don't think we'll go into that one today unless you unless we have loads of time.
12:04
But yeah, people get very confused by PowerPoints.
12:12
So your case study, did you just take ethical questions that you think are relevant and try and answer them in our understanding?
12:17
Well, I mean, really, you have one main ethical question you are answering.
12:23
It may not be phrased as a question that you all have a topic.
12:27
And the question is what happened in this situation. Was the response correct that what are the different views about this situation?
12:32
Sort of the meta level questions, what should be done in the future? How will this develop that?
12:43
And you may find some related areas which you can phrases, questions or some more specific ethical examples,
12:48
but questions is just a starting point to help you really with your discussion.
12:57
That, yeah, we'll come back.
13:04
I think we'll come back to the question about photography and pictures in a minute because as a slightly longer one to go into,
13:07
is it acceptable to point out ethical issues that have no relationship? Yes.
13:15
Is that that is fine? Lots of ethical issues that aren't related to computing at all.
13:18
But we would like the we need to with some application to computing in your presentations just to meet the requirements of the subject you're in.
13:25
But you can bring in related areas. But there will be new computers, technology or in the in sort of the background to almost all of these anyway.
13:35
For that, if you're a friend.
13:47
OK, last question here, if you reference one source or multiple slides and have the full reference to put on the side of the first mention.
13:49
And you just have the number in subsequent slides. I think you can so long as you keep your number inconsistent.
13:55
So if your first slide has numbers one and two, then the next slide is number three, etc. and your numbers sequentially.
14:00
Then you can get away with just referring to the previous sources because we've seen them up.
14:06
However, it never hurts to just have that in the future again.
14:11
If that fits nicely, O'Neill slide for that, but it's less essential once you've shown it once.
14:16
So that one do you need to refer to it properly or codes?
14:22
Or can you refer to others? You don't need to refer to Tripoli or BCS codes because they may not be relevant for every situation because I mean,
14:27
the BCS started on British Computer Society no longer uses that term.
14:36
It's much more international, but not every situation in that list relates to computing company.
14:40
So BCS may not be relevant there. They may have their own industry body, but they subscribe to.
14:48
Do you need to learn a new ethical framework? I'd warn against it.
14:56
You have limited time, and unless you're really confident with ethics, I'd say play safe because you're more likely to make errors.
15:03
Learning a new subject unless you're really confident about this.
15:15
I mean, I'm happy to talk more. I'm happy to suggest some ethical approaches that choke off the town.
15:19
Even Thomas has talked about consequential ism. I'm happy to talk about these things, but I would say,
15:26
unless you're confident that you do know about these things, don't learn a new ethical approach now.
15:33
The key thing is, if you say in your presentation, Well, we discuss this and we thought it was wrong, then that that's not going to gain your marks.
15:41
You've got to say why it's wrong. So saying it contradicts the code or the law or both.
15:53
It's a much stronger presentation than just we didn't like the idea.
16:00
I hope that's clear. You're entitled to your opinions, but if you're going to base your ethics just on your opinion,
16:06
that's not going to look good and it's not going to help you in the world of work, either.
16:14
If you imagine yourself at a project meeting and you say, you know, in the CEOs that you cite, I don't think we should do this.
16:19
Everybody instantly, you know, say, Well, why should we care what you think? How long have you been with the company?
16:27
I've got shirts older than you. You know, this is this is the sort of response you'll get.
16:32
Whereas if you can say, Well, I'm afraid they think I Tripoli code says we shouldn't do this,
16:37
then you've got a big organisation in your corner in that meeting.
16:43
I hope that's clear. And that's really important to understand.
16:47
But well, do I need to say, well, it's important that you learn that you know, your opinion is interesting,
16:50
but unless you've been asked for your opinion, it won't have a lot of weight, particularly if you're the junior person in the meeting.
17:00
Yeah, things play very well, said that. So do you need do you need a reason why you've chosen specific ethics decision making model?
17:09
I think it's nice if you can say a bit more rather than you just chose this one randomly.
17:19
But so as long as it's relevant, then I don't think we will be.
17:23
We will think too much about that when we are looking at these videos and and mocking you because we don't expect to use them.
17:28
I said to go and learn a lot of new things. Do you already know any ethical approaches like you do?
17:36
Partly because they are in the videos you've watched and partly because we've talked about
17:41
them and partly because you are you will have come across some of these things anyway,
17:45
and you'll want a life there and you'll have a personal understanding of ethics and morals and principles are that you apply for that one.
17:51
Do you need full citations in your life? Which is yeah, we talked about this yesterday a bit more, so have a look at that, but you need the you need.
18:00
You really need the full reference, as in how can people find this paper on the sly and at least the first time you use it?
18:09
That's that's a reference.
18:18
Rather than the citation, the citation citation is just going to be that number one for source one or whatever it might be for that.
18:19
So the citation will go on the slide and the reference to go with it. So that is my recommendation is yes.
18:26
Put the full reference on the somewhere on the slide in the footer or in a place you designate in your template for that.
18:32
And the reason you do that is because you just say you've got something source number one
18:40
and you don't say what source number one is on the slides and it is completely useless.
18:45
The person watching this video because we can't guess what your sources is.
18:49
We and we can't really keep stopping the video flicking forward 14 and half
18:53
minutes in when you show this and then flicking back to the start for that one.
18:57
So many of the live presentation as well. Incidentally, people can't really fast forward you in a live presentation, either is it occurred to me.
19:01
It's a technical aspect to the presentation.
19:09
If it has little relation, ethical drawbacks, i.e. the software implementation has almost nothing to do with the implications that arise.
19:10
Yeah, I think that is that is generally absolutely fine.
19:17
I'm just going to just say something to that.
19:21
You could say this was this particular piece of software was poorly implemented, bugs were spotted, it wasn't tested properly and so on.
19:25
And that's fine as a presentation. But also you need to show it would be well in your presentation to have something to say.
19:36
Why doing it? A poor technical job matters.
19:47
And the answer is, of course, bad software kills people basically in a slogan.
19:51
And if you're, I mean, put you put yourself in the position.
19:58
Unfortunately, I would predict that some of you will find yourself in this position before the decade is out,
20:02
where you're under pressure to release software, which you know to be effective, which you know, might cause an accident.
20:08
But there's commercial pressure on you this time pressure and people are saying things like,
20:15
Well, if we don't do agile competitors, well, you will hear this in meetings and so on.
20:19
And it's important to have a clear grasp that we expect high software standards, particularly in safety critical areas, for a reason.
20:25
It has bad consequences, and a lot of the cases we've looked at really do have bad consequences.
20:34
You might think, well, you know, the app, which I've put out of the game that I put in the App Store can't have bad consequences.
20:41
Well, maybe not, but a lot of bad software does have bad consequences.
20:48
And that and that's why we have standards. That's why you should do a good job.
20:52
I hope that's clear. I mean, that's the ethical issue, do a good job.
20:58
And in fact, while I've got the microphone outside, there's a paper by.
21:03
Heather, oh gosh, I can't remember her name now, but it's called the folly of trolleys.
21:11
And they said this is a reference to the trolley problem, which is an old standard in moral philosophy,
21:16
where there's a runaway tram, which is a trolley in American for those of you on bilingual.
21:23
And you can, if you do nothing, it will run over five people, but you can switch it on to a track where if you kill one person, what should you do?
21:30
And the first thing to note you say is there isn't a good answer to this question, right?
21:38
And a different model approaches give different answers to this question.
21:45
And if you if you think, well,
21:50
you should always try to minimise the number of deaths that I can show that that's the view that you won't always supply.
21:51
I'm afraid, particularly when it comes to deaths in other countries and wars and things that you could donate to stop them happening.
21:58
But what about the Roth, which is what Heather Ross says in this article, is in the design of autonomous vehicles.
22:06
The philosophers have jumped on it and said, here is a real world engineering application of the trolley problem.
22:16
Well, no, it isn't. You know, there's no way you programming the artificial intelligence in your autonomous vehicle can solve this problem.
22:23
That's been around, well, been around since 1969.
22:32
The original articles by Philip Approach, an Oxford philosopher and once, well,
22:37
you shouldn't what your duty is to make your technology as safe as possible, not to solve tedious, philosophical puzzles.
22:42
And that's, you know, that's I think that's really pretty great.
22:51
You make your autonomous vehicle as safe as you possibly can in writing your software.
22:55
That's that's your ethical duty. You don't have to solve a philosophical puzzle.
23:02
It's really it's in principle insoluble.
23:07
And again, I could say a lot more about this, but I don't want to confuse people trying to solve shut up that.
23:12
Yeah, thanks play. No, you just you're just proving that you could get, you know, 300 words by talking for about two minutes and have a summary.
23:19
If you just transcribe that just as people sometimes do, which always surprises people,
23:29
or I'm going to answer these questions about images, I'm going to share my screen to think about this a bit.
23:34
So. So in your opinion on this one, here we have a picture of one of the.
23:41
Leading ethical lights in the UK, let's say you wanted to give a quote from this person in in your talk, could you use this picture on your slides?
23:48
And this will come to. I asked had a voice that was going.
24:03
So I've just very quietly grabbed this in the background while I was talking, I mean,
24:12
it took me about 20 years because it's really hard to capture somebody without their mouths moving.
24:17
And when they look at the camera, they're saying do a lot better from a video so that.
24:21
Well, first of all, these are really for our internal years because, yes, there is a recording of this there,
24:30
and I suspect none of this would really bat an eyelid if you were to have a photo of blé on your slides.
24:37
For that to say that if he was the relevant person to quote,
24:50
but you have to think about where you get pictures from and whether people would be OK for that.
24:56
Now let's look at the corresponding example. Let's say you wanted to quote supply in.
25:02
You'd done a search on on Google images on Google and you get the image results and you got his website.
25:05
You got details about when to send him his birthday card and everything like that.
25:14
You got access to his many prominent books, is written in the field and everything else.
25:19
What about one of these pictures? Could you grab one of these and put it in your slides?
25:24
Perhaps, and I suspect in general, well.
25:31
I suspect in general, again, Blay would not mind it too much there, but theoretically speaking, yeah, these are still owned by somebody.
25:38
All these pictures for the fact that so.
25:47
But what I might do is I'm might, for instance,
25:54
go to his Wikipedia page and hope I'm not going to go there because just in case somebody has probably happened to many
25:57
of us in in academia and see if there was a licence photo in here which was signed to use in that kind of situation,
26:04
or I might look on his website to see if he has a media page for that and therefore has photos that
26:12
you would like to be used in a professional context where they've been very carefully posed for that.
26:18
As well. Otherwise I might get around that, and I have done it sometimes is, although you can't directly take photos,
26:27
is you might sometimes take a screenshot there and I just grab a screen area and use this as your illustration because for some reason,
26:36
the copyright on screenshots is a different situation to the copyright of individual images,
26:45
which is how Google, for instance, can get away with displaying thumbnails in its own search results for that.
26:52
So that's another possible approach there. Another approach I might use sometimes is to find a news story covering a particular situation
26:58
and to grab a picture of the screen of the news story or to grab a picture of the headline.
27:08
I mean, there are some copyright issues there as well, but it's not quite as pronounced a place I often go for images for talks is is Pixabay,
27:12
which in theory is is high quality, royalty free stock pictures and try and find things that illustrate, illustrate a particular situation.
27:23
I don't know what we will find with ethics. They're probably not being hugely useful, a bit too generic a term,
27:33
but I might sometimes put one of these type of signs like this one here in the background of
27:39
a talk or something alongside things so that that because these have been licenced for use,
27:43
Google Images as well has the.
27:50
If you just do a search, then it will come up with lots of material which may or may not be freely reusable.
27:57
But in in the tools, we can filter the usage rights by Creative Commons licences as as an alternative, which hopefully will find things useful.
28:03
It comes up quite a lot with with Wikimedia, which is a Wikipedia type site as well.
28:14
I wouldn't 100 percent trust this, but again,
28:20
that is another possible place where you can get images reminds me when I see this one here at the side word clouds as well.
28:23
It can generate yourself lots of free software to do that.
28:32
That can be another good way of quickly getting a nice image, which can help illustrate things.
28:35
Another thing you can do, of course, is to take photos yourself. They can be quite useful.
28:41
Have your own supply of photos to go with things as well. Yeah.
28:46
I mean, there were lots of stock photos sites out there, those are just a few examples.
28:51
You can find lists of them to help you for that.
28:55
That's. And.
28:59
I mean, you can generate some nice things as well by, I mean like this kind of image here, which is just like a Post-it Notes.
29:07
You can get software online to generate these or or you can just do the obvious thing,
29:17
which is take a photo of a post-it note on your desk where you've written on it.
29:22
These things are very easy. If you want a bit of illustration can quite work quite well.
29:26
Things like book covers while I see that well now, most, most of the time is not an issue.
29:31
Using a book cover on a talk because it really is advertising for that book.
29:38
So people want to see that book covers used for that.
29:42
One can use screenshots from social media posts.
29:47
I I personally use those quite often.
29:51
Yeah, because if it's publicly available social media, then it has been been released and so people should expect it to be be used and quoted.
29:56
Or I may sometimes grab the text of that and put that into another image.
30:06
But I mean, different people have slightly different views about whether people have given permission or not for their quotes to be reused.
30:11
But my view is that this is implicit with the fact that they have posted this publicly for comment in the first place.
30:19
I mean, think of how many newspapers nowadays use social media talks.
30:28
I use social media quotes to fill out their stories rather than having to go in.
30:32
In the old days, I would have to ring someone up and get them to give a quote over the phone to go and flesh their stories out there.
30:37
So that happens quite a lot as well.
30:45
Now there's a further level of protection you have when you when you're using images, which is the idea of academic fair use,
30:48
which means that quite often you can get away with doing something and saying you're doing this for academic use,
30:54
which you couldn't do if it was being done for a commercial talk there.
31:00
So you might say it's in the public interest or the academic interest to to cover this the source.
31:04
What you don't want to be is in a situation where you have a commercial photographer
31:11
who is selling photos and they charge a couple of hundred pounds an image.
31:14
They find that you have used their photo and then their solicitors contacts you and says because you didn't pay upfront,
31:18
the fee for using notes is not £200 anymore. It's now two thousand pounds, and you end up in quite a tricky situation for doing this.
31:26
So you may take this and say, I say use.
31:34
You may take this and edit it a bit there. There's different ways around it that people will use.
31:38
You're much safer being in education than if you were in the commercial world.
31:44
Screenshots of videos as well. Fall under much the same category.
31:50
They're very hard for anyone to have a trace, so you may find that using one screenshot.
31:55
It is covered as perfectly fair in this situation as well.
32:00
Further complications in my rough and ready summary of the situation.
32:06
Copyright law differs greatly from country to country, so you may find things you can do in the UK and not valid internationally about this one.
32:11
As well, and your slides really are already going to be looked at by us internally anyway, so this is not likely to be any issues,
32:21
but if you've got something that is this high standard light to make available for you to abuse
32:30
afterwards or something for your own professional portfolio or for us to share with future students,
32:35
then there may be slightly more issues if people ever find this.
32:41
But so often I will use, say, something from a news story.
32:46
That's because I consider it in the public interest to share that information.
32:50
That and generally reporters and journalists like this information being shared because it helps to promote them.
32:54
So it's not usually an issue, but you will find horror stories all over the web about these kind of things.
33:01
If you take a screenshot, who do you cite that? Well, in in many cases, let's say it was I took a screenshot of this,
33:09
it's very obvious this Google image search results for the term ethics, and there isn't really a great deal of to cite.
33:19
But I might just put a small box in the corner saying Google Image results for the search, term ethics or something like that just to cover it.
33:25
If it's a very obvious source like a newspaper, I would try and cite the original newspaper article rather than my my screenshots.
33:36
There was a little bit of a judgement call this one.
33:44
If somebody has said you can use this image, you have to sign it, then use the citation they must have used.
33:47
That can happen quite a bit as well for that one. But if it's just like Pixabay where you don't need to recite it or of the stock image.
33:53
Sites or sources them, there is nothing in that ghost site because this is part of the agreement with the site there,
34:05
although you can never completely trust that people have had permission to upload all of these images that see any downside.
34:13
But generally, I find this one quite reliable that believe me, I'm sure there's loads more I could say on that one.
34:20
Any more thoughts? And I think the main thing is to be aware that you can't just take images without permission and so on.
34:28
I mean, it does happen a lot and you've probably got away with it until now.
34:41
But we need to we need as part of our teaching mission to make sure that you are careful about this.
34:46
And you'll note that Thomas refused to show you videos of last year's presentation on the grounds that we didn't have permission to show you them.
34:55
And it's very tempting because I could say, Hey, take a look at this.
35:05
This group did really well because I have these videos, but unfortunately, without the permission of the students concerned, we can't use them.
35:08
Yeah. And with this being an ethics module as well, we have to be slightly careful what you tell you in this module,
35:20
you will certainly get staff in other modules who say, Don't worry about this, just do what you want, and it's not really the correct advice.
35:28
I think you have to take your own your own judgement here about this.
35:34
And if you go and work in companies, then they will be the people in many of the companies who are very what you what images you use.
35:39
And you may even find a lot of companies nowadays, they've got their own library of stock photos that they expect you to stick to.
35:46
And they have their own templates for talks expected to work within.
35:53
So you don't have the same amount of freedom we've got. Yeah.
35:57
And in terms of the videos from last year, it's a shame we can't share some of the excellent ones.
36:01
But by the same token, sometimes people then take this as the definitive way to do these presentations.
36:05
We're really keen to see your ideas and creativity as well without saying just go ahead and directly copy this format from last year.
36:12
No, really, I'm OK. So that just things to think about.
36:19
You're building. You've got a nice size group, so you've got lots of experience so you can find ways to keep people engaged,
36:23
interested in all of these subjects that I think you should be undergoing a change and growing up at this point,
36:30
because when you're a talented actor, so I'm pretty sure an awful lot of you have been,
36:40
then you don't worry too much about permissions and reproducing images very easy to capture.
36:47
In fact, you probably all know all sorts of ways around the defence mechanisms the sites put up against this.
36:55
But when you go out to work in the commercial world, if you do this and get your company into trouble, they will hang you out to dry.
37:02
They won't take the blame for you. They'll happily let you get prosecuted, you get fined and the courts will take a very legalistic view of it.
37:11
So it's important that, you know, you kind of change your attitude.
37:20
You're not a teenage hacker anymore. You're a professional in the profession, so you have to make certain changes and be aware of these things.
37:25
It's just part of your development, your professional development. Yes, I'm just thinking of another question.
37:35
I get asked quite a lot, which is about taking things like diagrams, academic papers and you.
37:42
Let's define my surprise these things like you write a textbook and the academic field,
37:47
they're incredibly hard in making sure you have permission to use every single image in that book.
37:52
All right, you've signed this off. You can't just go and take somebody's existing image from an academic paper.
37:56
Now there's no reason, though you can't make your own diagram with exactly the same information,
38:02
or perhaps slightly enhance or personalise your situation that happens all the time there.
38:07
And it may seem to you that you've got exactly the same words. You've got essentially very similar boxes.
38:13
Well, a very similar flow chart, whatever it might be,
38:19
but it suddenly becomes your diagram because you've done that and you still reference the original paper.
38:21
But that's the way these things work. It's just the yeah, these rules you, you work within.
38:27
And it gives me just another quick idea for things like, say you want a nice 10 second video clip rather than a live slide,
38:34
you can just do things like open up a a dos window or a command line window or Unix shell and type in a command
38:42
and and then you have 10 seconds of something going on or type into a document or whatever it might be for that.
38:51
Can you see the graph from a paper? If you reference the graph is actually the same answers the question I just gave you on images.
39:00
So for our purposes, and we probably will not care too much.
39:08
But the official answer is that you should redraw the graph and you should include a reference to the original data source,
39:13
which might be the academic paper so that when when we say redraw,
39:21
if you make fairly minor alterations, that will in fact get you through in court,
39:29
I'm not telling you to change that, but a redrawing is a fairly small alteration to something like a growth.
39:35
But we will we will look for that, and it's pretty obvious if something is just cut and pasted or if it's been edited.
39:44
Yeah, but redraw or we really mean is open up excel or your preferred spreadsheet software puts it in the numbers and the
39:55
headers and click the button to generate the grass and then you have something that is in the form that you want.
40:03
And if you have any sense at that point, you'll also just play around with the colour scheme and the spacing.
40:09
So it makes a nice slide as opposed to a black and white graph inside an academic paper, which is doesn't make it very neat looking slide anyway.
40:15
So it suddenly looks so much more impressive by doing that, and you can find ways to generate graphs online as well,
40:25
incidentally, and get really nice looking graphs for presentations. If you have the the time and motivation.
40:31
And the other thing about graphs, as you might find, actually,
40:37
this graph has got multiple columns there or it's showing three different variables and you only need two of them,
40:40
so you simplify your version of your slide. What is the ruling about using a company's logo in your slides?
40:48
I don't know the answer to that. That's a very good question. I mean, yes, certification is like officially speaking, trademark terms.
40:56
But yeah, copyright terms you should put it doesn't mean you can't use them in your talk,
41:06
but really should put a copyright symbol next to them or trademark symbol or whatever it might be for this one.
41:11
I think in general, companies are quite keen to have their logos used and promoted.
41:19
So it does not normally end up as a huge issue here unless you're being incredibly critical about them in which case and in a public setting.
41:25
And they may consider this not acceptable.
41:35
For that, just for instance.
41:41
So I have no problem when I'm doing talks on behalf of Imperial for obvious reasons, putting an imperial logo in the slides,
41:43
but that is actually acknowledging the organisation is paying me or I'm giving an external talk for another university.
41:48
I will often the external organisation's logo in and the imperial logo in, because that matches quite nicely there.
41:56
But sometimes you might just want somebody to give a flavour of that company, which is not particularly controversial.
42:05
So I haven't got a great answer for that perfect answer to that one because it gets a little bit tricky.
42:13
But if the company has got, for instance, a page with downloadable logos for public use, then clearly they're happy with that,
42:19
which many companies have slave and provide the logo with a transparent background to make it very easy for people to use.
42:26
And you have the the international complications, as with so many things.
42:36
Yeah, I'm thinking I may have missed one question when we're scrolling through as well here.
42:42
Yeah, that's what it's all about. I mean, screenshots I sort of covered.
42:49
I'm generally fine with screenshots, and I use them quite often to illustrate things.
42:53
And I feel screenshot is just a screenshot of a single photo, then is pushing it a bit.
43:00
But if it's illustrating a wider area, I think you can use the same ruling that allows Google to show you these screenshots
43:05
in the first place and to show you many images of other sites and things like that,
43:10
because they would consider it fair use in a commercial setting. So we would definitely consider it fair use in an academic setting.
43:15
I mean, there's a question about hypothetical scenarios. What is our opinion on those, especially if the question is in the past,
43:25
is it a valid way of making arguments or is it irrelevant and not focussed on the question?
43:31
I mean, it's going to be one of these one, and let's say it depends on who you with the.
43:37
I think if you want to go into the area of science fiction. Be very careful because it is fiction and acknowledge that it's science fiction.
43:44
If you want to say know, would the crash not have happened if people had been notified two days earlier?
43:54
That sort of hypothetical that I'm fine with that because that's the sort of hypothetical.
44:03
In a way, ethical reasoning always involves hypotheticals and predictions about the future,
44:09
even when you talk about these contrived examples of runaway trends and so on.
44:17
You're always talking about what's likely to happen, what you're what you could reasonably foresee.
44:22
So, yeah, it depends, but it's clear hypothetical.
44:29
If only they'd done this, you know, if only they acknowledged the hack four weeks before they did acknowledge it,
44:34
then people would have known and protected their data. Things like that.
44:43
I'm quite I'm quite happy with those. I mean, none of the none of the topics are actually science fiction.
44:48
None of them are actually about robots taking over the world or stuff like that.
44:57
We certainly don't think so. Maybe, maybe there was one about Asimov's three laws, but Asimov's three laws are being talked about.
45:04
They're all pretty much things that have happened or are all happening are being debated in companies right now.
45:10
So you shouldn't need to get too hypothetical. You should think of yourself as a team management team involved in the relevant decisions.
45:19
I'm sorry if that's a rather vague answer, but I'm you say touch hypotheticals you want to run.
45:31
That's as specific as I can be. Maybe Thomas can be a bit more specific.
45:38
Well, the problem was hypothetical questions are you got hypothetical aesthetical answers, so I can't be that specific.
45:47
But I mean, one thing that is relevant in many of these presentations is what would happen if this situation occurred again in the future?
45:54
Well, that is very much a hypothetical question. So you can't get away with it that.
46:02
Would anyone have learnt anything?
46:06
Would the response be different because there are unfortunately some situations that will happen again with the best will in the world.
46:08
If we're looking at things like an aeroplane crashing than we would like to say, this will never happen again.
46:17
But unfortunately it is going to happen again. And so the response is the important thing,
46:22
as opposed to clearly designing out the opportunities for crashes as far as possible, an engine failure is important.
46:28
But these things are just completely unavoidable.
46:36
In my lecture, I actually I covered the Sony hack, and one of the questions I say you should answer is, is it fixed?
46:41
Could it happen again? So could it happen again?
46:50
It's a hypothetical that I've I've actually asked students to cover, but I mean, it's certainly the could it happen again?
46:54
Question can be really quite useful in the concluding section of your talk.
47:02
If you think about it, is it correct? Yeah, very true.
47:06
So an easy question, what citation formats are we supposed to use?
47:14
So within our department, our standard citation format referencing format is Vancouver referencing that is the format.
47:17
We use numbers to refer to sources, but it's actually one of many formats.
47:24
We use numbers to refer to sources because there are, I suspect there are over 100 referencing formats in in years.
47:29
But as I think I mentioned in one of the lectures there and there are two main ones that you see in education,
47:36
one of them is called the Vancouver format. One of them is called the Harvard format, which is a name type format.
47:42
But the one we use in the department is the Vancouver format. I don't necessarily think it's the best one,
47:48
but this is the one the department has chosen to use for scientific type work that it has the benefit
47:54
that the citations don't take up much space because they're just single digits or double digits.
48:00
But then you still have the full source of the reference as well,
48:07
because otherwise people would never be able to go and trace back what the reference was.
48:11
And that goes at the bottom of the slide, or it goes at the end of the summary.
48:15
It was a really complicated grass like a map from a paper, and we can't really copy it.
48:20
Can we take a screenshot of the paper area with the grass or is that not allowed?
48:24
We are not going to enforce this too strictly for the purposes of this module.
48:30
If we if we think your approach is appropriate.
48:39
I mean, when you say, I presume you mean something like a network graph or something like that.
48:45
I mean, if it was a real physical geographical map, then a lot of people would just say, you wanted to highlight a location.
48:51
They might grab a picture from Google Maps. I mean, that is slightly pushing copyright or open maps would probably be a better example there as well.
48:59
If it's a very complicated network graph and you can't recreate it,
49:10
then I think you would be OK to cite academic fair use and to put that in in your presentation.
49:13
But at the same time, I would say if you if you're if you're presenting,
49:21
is overly complicated and it's going to be flashed up on a slide for 20 seconds and people can't really do anything with it, I'll take it in then.
49:26
Is there any need for doing something so complicated or could you do a more high level version of that of that map and just
49:34
show perhaps some of the main flows around in your own diagram and cover the things that somebody would really want to know?
49:42
And it will depend on the situation, the situation for that one there.
49:48
But yeah, you can. You get away with a screenshot in that situation and they can tell another story.
49:55
So once I wrote a paper about maps for me, well, it was about computer representation of knowledge,
50:01
but it was focussed on maps, what maps deliberately omits and so on.
50:08
And obviously, it contained a lot of maps, and I had to check the copyright for the publisher.
50:12
And everybody said yes, except Ordnance Survey, who could not be persuaded to let me reproduce even a little bit of their map.
50:18
They were for academic purposes. So I had to work around that.
50:26
Everyone else's diagrams and so on. But on its and I suspect Google Maps might take a similar attitude.
50:33
But I would suggest in this case that you will search in some way that you redraw it.
50:40
So it isn't just a screenshot because a screenshot clearly is stealing someone else's work.
50:45
But if you've modified it, then it isn't. That's an on the citation thing.
50:53
Yes. Vancouver Department of Computing Imperial uses Vancouver, but when you go out to work,
51:01
you'll find a different system and you may very well join a company and say what referencing system should I use?
51:07
And they'll look at you blankly. You know, should I use Vancouver or Harvard?
51:15
What on earth are you talking about what you do in that situation? And I have been in that situation, as you say, can I see some previous reports?
51:19
And then you find out the company's particular style for these things very important,
51:28
particularly if you're going to work in other countries where conventions are different and important to
51:32
realise that there will be conventions in your company and you have to sort of hit the ground running.
51:40
And the best way is to ask to look at some examples of previous reports before you go right up yours and use the wrong convention.
51:46
I hope that's clear. Yeah, things play for that one yet, and they're always.
51:53
I mean, Ordnance Survey are always very, very hot on maintaining their copyright for the geographical Typekit maps.
52:03
But something like OpenStreetMap, just looking in the background is is an option for for user generated data.
52:09
So some of your options now for images and graphics and supporting materials and resources have been there were 10 years ago, so it is wide open.
52:17
Sometimes I actually can have too much choice, not not too little choice there.
52:27
So referencing, we've got more interesting questions referencing we're mostly interested in the spirit of what
52:33
you're doing rather than we're going to go and check every reference in huge amounts of detail here,
52:40
just if nothing else, because the amount of time we've got to review this,
52:45
you may get more comments in your summary from Brett and his team for referencing it.
52:49
But just try and give credit, try and follow the format.
52:55
So I've put a link in the chat to the library's of reference guide.
53:00
If you're watching the video, I'm fairly sure this is this is linked anyway on the from the assignment or from the Oh,
53:05
it's definitely linked in the videos.
53:12
But if you have a look at that, then they go through different types of sources that you might need to try and reference.
53:14
And essentially, it's just a fill in the blanks type structure, really, and you follow this format.
53:21
So that's. That's what that's what you do.
53:27
So you find a particular type of reference and and you go through that.
53:33
So if you're saying you're referencing a PDF there, then you need a bit more than the name of a PDF still to support this one.
53:38
Because I in the name of a PDF, which we don't know where this PDF came from.
53:49
Is this a random file you found in a Google search? Is it in a particularly companies website you got the PDF from?
53:55
Is it a satellite? You know, it's not brilliant sources in most cases, but it could be something you found.
54:02
So, so you will reference the file.
54:08
You'll also need to say what the source was, whether that's website, whether that's an online repository was nearly always going to be online.
54:11
If the PDF, whether it's something you were sent by email, which kind of happened,
54:18
let's imagine things like bleak data, which people can find ways to reference and then just follow the format.
54:22
So saying as a PDF.
54:29
I mean, an academic paper could be a PDF, but there will still be a formal academic reference, which is going to be what journalist just published in.
54:31
What was the who are the authors of that PDF that you include there rather than just the name?
54:38
Can your conclusion be that it would not be ethical to make the countermeasures
54:47
necessary to prevent an accident happening again and nothing should be done?
54:50
I mean, that could be a valid conclusion you could come to in some situations that does the end justify the means time?
54:55
A question that seems perfectly reasonable. That is that is your opinion as well.
55:02
You may sometimes say there is a there is a common opinion.
55:06
Their opinions would differ based on what stakeholder you speak to for that one that you got very different views about things.
55:10
I mean, think about, say, the discussions about legalising certain types of drugs,
55:20
you will get people with a very strong line views saying unethical to do that, to think about all the harm.
55:25
And you'll get people with a very strong line view saying that it's some.
55:31
It's not ethical not to legalise them because of the crime that is generated.
55:35
So it's very, very rare. You get just a single viewpoint for anything.
55:40
And so we have this difficult situation of trying quite often to present the balanced view, even though we can bring in our own opinion a bit.
55:45
We have exactly the same problem as lectures because we have to present the balanced viewpoint.
55:53
It doesn't mean it's always our viewpoint. It doesn't mean we're always in full agreement with the processes in operation and all university there.
55:57
It doesn't mean, let's say, in the situation that affords a situation,
56:04
I see a senior tutor that somebody has failed the module and the can't be offered any more attempts of that.
56:08
It doesn't mean it was in full agreement, but this is the this is the process we have to to operate under.
56:15
And so you get even these difficult ethical or moral dilemmas at a very much a personal level as well as the big society level.
56:21
Yeah, regulation is flavour of the month right now. Very play.
56:35
Yeah, I mean, I have to say realistically, you know, 20 years ago, the Big Tech companies were very effective at saying, get off our backs.
56:40
If you regulate this, we won't be able to develop the technology. And so.
56:49
But that pendulum has swung maybe too much back the other way.
56:53
I think in 2010, I was involved in a thought leadership debate about social networks, which mean which meant Facebook back then.
56:59
And we only the only conclusion we could come to is that it should be part of the national curriculum, how to behave online.
57:09
But now, even even Mark Zuckerberg goes before Congress and says we should have been regulating police regulators.
57:17
If you expect us to sit content and censor, please tell us how to do it.
57:25
And certainly in the autonomous vehicles field, the manufacturers are poised,
57:31
ready to go and then calling in people like me, calling in lawyers and saying, You know what?
57:35
We need guidance. We need regulation.
57:40
So I mean, it's not just that the regulators want to regulate, it's more that the industry say, OK, we need regulation.
57:43
Please give us some guidance. Well, what content is unacceptable?
57:50
What sort of algorithm goes too far in letting people see things?
57:54
And how do you want us to keep this out of children and so on?
57:59
So yeah, it's quite interesting. It's very interesting indeed, I think there would be more regulation, except the global politics involved.
58:05
So I'm just but you can certainly argue against it.
58:17
Yeah, lots of people have argued against it. Most of my career. Yeah.
58:23
And we've got really great questions here. Essentially the same question in different ways.
58:28
How do you go about reaching ethical conclusions in a way that on entirely an opinion?
58:36
And then the corresponding angry as well? Should this be the presentation, be a balanced view or can it be heavily opinionated?
58:42
Well, I'm going to. I'm just going to say pick up the second one of those first there, then.
58:49
I mean, we are not going to overly prescribe this people.
58:56
You can come down more on one side than the other.
59:00
But my preference is very much that you had you show very clear reason and you present different viewpoints in order to to draw that opinion.
59:04
This is not you doing your article for Fox News there,
59:15
where you can very much come down in your heavily opinionated and unbalanced
59:19
side about why nobody should be should be vaccinated and about all the dangers
59:24
about vaccination to your unborn babies and everything that might be there or
59:30
or why it is not just the not just the right of every American to carry a gun,
59:37
but any echo, and it doesn't have time machine guns in that cupboard is not following their moral duties as a good citizen or whatever.
59:43
It might be their opinions, if probably. And you have your own opinion about that controversial statement,
59:50
which I don't agree with incidentally there, but that is certainly not balanced viewpoints for that one.
59:55
So my view is you have to have a bit of balance to get to that viewpoint.
1:00:02
And we're quite fair to share your own example. Some people have very personal examples, right in some of the questions as well,
1:00:07
which can be quite relevant to bring into the discussion because of their own background and everything you've gone through in your life,
1:00:13
that can be helpful as well. And even then, we all got these things.
1:00:19
We feel very opinionated that we have to try and see things from multiple viewpoints
1:00:25
to get there in order to show why our viewpoint is likely to be the more correct one.
1:00:29
It's not a it's not a debate in the way that you experienced debaters here are going to go and focussing purely on one's viewpoint and try
1:00:33
and take down all the opposing sides views as a very different style of things that you don't normally get to do in academia for that.
1:00:40
But so then the other part of the question is how do you develop these balanced viewpoints and draw a conclusion?
1:00:50
Well, a lot of drawing conclusion is going to be opinion and weighing things up.
1:00:58
But how would you get the balanced viewpoints? I mean, you may have a good idea of a framework, a process to follow, but to me,
1:01:02
a lot of this is about identifying the different viewpoints by reading around the subject,
1:01:09
seeing what has already been said, thinking about who the different stakeholders are in this problem.
1:01:13
That was, the stakeholders or shareholders at the time were seniors, whether it's the management, whether it is consumers.
1:01:18
One of many other groups that can appear it depends very much on the problem.
1:01:28
But even even, let's say in the group of consumers, you'll get different viewpoints within that one group.
1:01:32
So that is not one unique group. Everyone has the same view about something so that one that can't play.
1:01:38
How would you go about this one? Well, I think when I hand out the marks, I'll be looking at it.
1:01:46
I'm probably going to give lower marks for a highly opinionated piece.
1:01:54
It's quite alright to come to a conclusion and that conclusion to be your opinion on the matter.
1:02:00
But it's also important to show that you realise that the people who disagree with you are not idiots, that they're not uninformed.
1:02:05
They've simply come to a different conclusion from here. And I'm to respect that and try and show why you think your conclusion.
1:02:15
So I would look for quite a good portrayal of the opposite view.
1:02:24
So I don't think we've got it this year.
1:02:29
But but a quite of favours in previous years being Apple versus the FBI and the view in the industry was that Apple shouldn't have allowed the FBI.
1:02:31
They were quite correct to refuse to unlock the iPhone, an iPhone found in possession of a known terrorist, by the way.
1:02:43
But you know, there is there is an opposing view from that.
1:02:52
I'm not saying the FBI always got it right, but it is their job to catch the bad guys.
1:02:56
And it's Apple's job to make a profit for Apple.
1:03:01
There is a there is an important counter view to Apple should respect the privacy of their customers that what you're doing and
1:03:04
if you're if you're a set of question like that in your presentation is showing an ability to see both sides of the argument.
1:03:13
And I don't mind if you have, you know,
1:03:22
somebody putting one side of the case and somebody putting the other side of the case and then a final summary at the end.
1:03:24
But I'm looking in the market to see that you realise there is another side.
1:03:31
The case is not going to be rude about people who disagree with you.
1:03:36
The the academic term, you know, the strongest academic term you can use is severely mistaken.
1:03:40
In other words, the other side have made a mistake, and then the onus is on you to show what that mistake is and to realise that,
1:03:47
you know, they're not idiots, so badly motivated and so on.
1:03:56
I mean, I can give an example.
1:04:02
You might have got the impression when I said, if there's no shareholders involved, put stakeholders all of and in repeating,
1:04:03
pointing out that a whistleblower has said that Facebook is more interested in profit than people.
1:04:12
I have to say shareholders are important. If you set up a start up in a couple of years now,
1:04:17
your shareholders will be the people who gave you the money to develop your technology and they're entitled to return.
1:04:24
You know, they're giving you the money because they think you'll give them a return.
1:04:30
Sure, shareholders are important. And you know what? They are giving them a return, particularly if you borrow their money to build your company.
1:04:34
That's important to this. There's two sides to all these arguments.
1:04:42
Yeah, Start-Up shareholders likely to be very few of them and very interested and hands on and wanting to influence the company.
1:04:48
And so you take money from somebody then do you have a duty to follow everything?
1:04:59
They say, Well,
1:05:04
if you're a shareholder and they're more than 50 percent of they don't have that much choice on that point because that's a shares work for that.
1:05:05
And and yes, I mean, it's one thing I just put in the charts as well, which just occurred to me while you were talking, playing as well,
1:05:11
is that we do try and deliberately vary the topics and choices available for these ethical topics ethical cases every year,
1:05:19
partly because it keeps them interesting and fresh for us. It's interesting and fresh for you.
1:05:29
It doesn't mean every one of them is absolutely perfect, but that is part of the learning process for all of us.
1:05:33
But I mean, also, we don't want you to be in a situation where you suddenly find out what your friend did this assignment last year,
1:05:39
they did exactly the same case and they send you the slides. What do you do in that situation there?
1:05:45
Because if you then just handing those slides, then that's going to be plagiarism.
1:05:50
And so I would rather avoid putting that temptation in front of you as my ethical view.
1:05:55
Now you will see a different view in other modules where some lecturers will set the same assignment year in year,
1:06:01
and there are whole archives of entities available online. If you go and choose to use them that you could almost be waiting to trap you,
1:06:08
knowing that it's a previous answer that you've handed in and put you through a process.
1:06:16
I completely agree with that, but that is one of the things that happens in the the world of education.
1:06:20
So because people don't always write fresh assignments every year for our style of teaching, this is not such a big deal.
1:06:26
Apart from having to review things and think up new, think of new topics and just make sure things are fresh and interesting.
1:06:33
But again, some areas you can't necessarily come up with a really good,
1:06:42
interesting piece of technical coursework every year and keep changing it around. So there are some tricks to this, too.
1:06:46
Can I just say I do hope Apple versus the FBI is something that people are doing this year?
1:06:52
But one of the better answers I saw to that because it's helpful to give any actually put a pie chart of what people thought,
1:06:58
what various sectors of the US population answered in favour of the FBI are in favour of Apple.
1:07:08
And it showed, you know, that people in the tech sector, particularly Silicon Valley,
1:07:16
were very much in favour of Apple, but the majority of the US population were in favour of the FBI.
1:07:19
And just just doing that, just showing on one of your slides that there are varying opinions about, the question really takes the box.
1:07:25
It takes the box easily. Now I know you realise there are two sides to this argument.
1:07:34
Yeah. Yeah, exactly, I can't remember now if Apple goes FBI as the topic,
1:07:43
because there are 52 of them all up there that were chosen, and I do hope not, I've seen so many of the pieces.
1:07:48
But I mean, some of you, we have given you some ideas anyway about things which probably do overlap or you're in a related area.
1:07:56
But listen and learn from them. That's why we're giving you these these ideas.
1:08:07
It may not be your exact topic, but the general principles apply quite nicely.
1:08:10
And in terms of ethical frameworks,
1:08:16
there is nothing to stop you doing a ten minute search for a framework that you think is fairly easy to follow and will apply to your situation,
1:08:18
particularly if you have something which you know. Although we're asking you to make sure there's a competing perspectives on some topics,
1:08:29
then more of a solid business, the ethical framework would fit in well for the purposes of your discussion then.
1:08:34
Yeah, I mean, there's quite lots of different examples. I'm not going to go through them.
1:08:41
It's not exciting. And the web pages, I've just looked in the background to remind myself of some of them.
1:08:45
They're very easy to follow. They're often also bullet points the things you might consider as a manager about
1:08:51
ethics or things you might consider as a thinking about the consumer viewpoint.
1:08:57
And you can just look through those four ideas to guide your discussion.
1:09:02
Clearly, a list of considerations is not the same thing as a list of answers, so you still have to do some work,
1:09:05
but you don't need to come up with all of these questions or all of these ideas for approach is completely from a A0 starting
1:09:11
point because this information is out there and there's nothing that should be taxing for you to think about for these.
1:09:20
Yeah. Yeah, but I mean, it's interesting about I suppose I could just give off the top of my head years ago,
1:09:29
I was part of a Royal Academy of Engineering Committee that was supposed to coordinate codes of conduct across
1:09:38
different branches of engineering or basically make sure they didn't say different things to each other.
1:09:45
And I was struck that they set out in different ways, and some put more emphasis on other things.
1:09:51
But there are some basic principles in all engineering codes, which I could just say, you know what?
1:09:59
Don't do engineering so that it kills people or injures people.
1:10:05
Can I put that respect public safety in public goods, but that that's always a major flaw, sometimes in more detail?
1:10:09
Another. Don't tell people that you can do things that you can't, you know, don't over over represent your capabilities.
1:10:17
If you think something's not right, then then say so. So that's another important thing.
1:10:25
Don't take bribes some of your own. Don't take bribes and others and have a respect for the profession.
1:10:30
Don't say everyone in computing is a charlatan.
1:10:37
So at the BCS, expect you to represent the computing profession.
1:10:43
So, you know, saying I see myself as a computer or we see ourselves as computing professionals,
1:10:49
and that's why we're saying this is an easy mark winner in this.
1:10:56
I mean, you find the codes, you know? Yeah, some of them go into lots more detail, but that's the basic things.
1:11:00
Feel free to disagree. I mean, if you think it's okay to build software that kills people, I'd be interested to hear that.
1:11:07
But most people don't, even even by accident.
1:11:13
Even to build a ship and put too few lifeboats on it.
1:11:18
Most people think that's wrong. Right.
1:11:23
Yeah. There's no there's no easy answers on that for many of these.
1:11:27
I mean, driverless cars is one of the has been topical area for the past few years.
1:11:31
It will continue to be if you're if you're a driverless car and you develop it.
1:11:36
And I, let's say driving across a cliff top and somebody runs out in front of you and your choices,
1:11:40
you swerve the car off the top of the cliff or you run down the person in front of you, which should the car do.
1:11:47
And there is no easy answer to to that kind of question.
1:11:53
So you have to come to a way to turn up or to reference in the charts.
1:11:57
I hope everyone got to see my reference to the to the Brookings report on that, which which I think is quite is quite good.
1:12:02
Oh yes, you did. Maybe, maybe that was subconsciously, maybe I'd just seen us in the background.
1:12:12
And Heather Ross argument is you don't have to solve complex philosophical issues, but you do have to do a good job.
1:12:17
You do have to ensure that your technology is as safe as possible.
1:12:24
And in the computing field, I think that applies again.
1:12:28
You know, you should not write stuff that you know is inadequate.
1:12:32
You should not release buggy code or algorithms that are prejudiced and so on if it's really quite simple.
1:12:36
Yeah, because every every bit of code practically has released it in a commercial setting, that always happens.
1:12:47
But some of these are going to be more. Some of these are going to be more crucial to others.
1:12:55
So if you know there are bugs in it and you're a developer, is it your responsibility to fix them?
1:12:59
Bearing in mind, you might be one of a team of 50 developers working on this. Another great deal of say there.
1:13:04
So there was all these difficult, difficult dilemmas in that.
1:13:10
And he I mean, I had better go because find it very soon and you probably want to do a bit of work.
1:13:15
And he last quick question. So anything you'd like to talk about.
1:13:20
I've already offered to one student to take a question by email so people can email me if they want more details.
1:13:24
So yeah, the subsequent email or read or whatever the the person is, I've answered a few,
1:13:35
but I'm not going to go into in-depth answers by email just and I can't guarantee I will
1:13:43
get to them in the next few hours because I go back to back with many things today then,
1:13:49
including trying to get my booster jab at some point. Yes.
1:13:54
Good luck with that.
1:13:57
Well, I'm booked and booked in, but it is going to take a book to read and I how I how my phone doubles up for everything nowadays.
1:13:59
Yes, I'm hopeful. Not too long with that one because it is such a busy day.
1:14:10
Otherwise, that's a that is a digression, as so often happens.
1:14:14
But yeah, just that. One of the points you're going to make plan out the style of the the presentation.
1:14:20
You can fill in the details over the next 24 hours or so this.
1:14:27
We do have a meeting tomorrow afternoon for more questions,
1:14:32
but that's quite late in the day for for detailed questions about ethical frameworks or anything like that that is more finishing touches,
1:14:35
quick edits, some comments about writing the summary where you might be in a position to have
1:14:44
at least addressed the summary by that point and things we could help with.
1:14:49
So and then as I've said earlier in the week, that video editing is not is not a last minute task.
1:14:53
It does take a bit of time. It just take a bit of time to render it upload and the people to review things and
1:15:01
even down to silly things like watching the video back and checking the sound,
1:15:07
as well as from person to person,
1:15:10
which just automatically if you yeah, if one person is really loud and then the next person is whispering or has a faulty microphone,
1:15:12
but then never actually watched you back then these are things you're you're going to notice.
1:15:21
And if you have one person who's really poor quality sound or something like that,
1:15:26
which kind of happen because you're all in different situations, there are free websites online.
1:15:31
We can run the sound through and it will clean it up, which is quite handy nowadays for things like that.
1:15:35
Again, you've got a little bit of time for these. Wow.
1:15:40
Yeah. OK, so there's no final thoughts, then then thank you for this really interesting discussion.
1:15:46
As always, we always get from these sessions as they say, Oh, I need to prepare some more lectures on this paper,
1:15:52
watching events as soon as we start talking about image, copyright or something like that.
1:15:58
At the same time, it is. I know you don't have time to watch all these things in advance,
1:16:01
so it is also balancing a balancing act to keep things realistic and achievable for all of us.
1:16:06
For that, then some of these topics are moving as we speak.
1:16:12
Don't don't assume that the 2021 answer will still apply in five years because there's that's generally speaking, the government.
1:16:17
In fact, most European governments are very unhappy with copyright law.
1:16:28
They think it's holding things back, so they may very well repeal it.
1:16:33
Just to throw that to watch out for that. Things change all the time.
1:16:39
You're quite right. And then you get the complications with copyright law.
1:16:44
Like, if I say, go to the United States and give a talk, I have to comply with a different set of rules.
1:16:47
Yes.
1:16:52
Well, even if I write my talk in the U.K. and then I put it up on, say, SlideShare, and it's hosted in the U.S., what sort of rules do I comply with?
1:16:53
So I always try and comply with the spirit of the rules.
1:17:00
I can't guarantee 100 percent in compliance with the law in all situations, but if I'm ever in a problem, I will plead academics.
1:17:03
I use and try and get things. I go through things that way.
1:17:11
I just have boring slides. The students will have noticed. I'm very careful about the images.
1:17:16
I think I said this in a talk, but I have a level of effort I put into my slides depending on where it is being used, how often they will be watched.
1:17:24
How often have you updated and whether it is being viewed externally.
1:17:34
So I must admit, I apologise for anyone here.
1:17:39
I will put slightly more effort into a talk which is being delivered externally and being archived on YouTube
1:17:42
for all time and being tweeted about on social media and being used to promote me for my future and everything.
1:17:47
Then perhaps I will for something that 10 people inside the department are going to are going to watch,
1:17:53
and whether it is what the flavour of the ideas, but that is also time management and working smart.
1:18:00
So there are all kinds of things that go into these decisions that whether it is a question for you to consider,
1:18:06
but it is a sensible decision from where I look at things that but yeah.
1:18:13
And some people just do slides which are in latex and have tiny fonts on a nearly unreadable and make little sense.
1:18:20
So they're all kinds of different levels. Some, some people here will say you do your slides that way.
1:18:29
And that is the most perfect set of slides you could ever make. That is the beauty of computer scientists and different opinions.
1:18:35
Right on that controversial note. I think I should I should close off.
1:18:41
So thank you, everyone. Keep going with things.
1:18:45
Ask questions. See you tomorrow. By.
1:18:49
