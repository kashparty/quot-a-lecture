Let us press on and let us look again at the definition of convergence to limit so a sequence and convergence to the Matel in the real numbers.
0:15
If and only the following is can be shown to be true for every absolute greater than zero that we can get arbitrarily close,
0:28
we can find an end in capital and such that for all little and greater than in the distance between the little M and L is less than Epsilon.
0:38
What this means is no matter how close,
0:51
so people can give us a distance from the limit and we can get within this distance of the within this distance by going far enough in the sequence.
0:54
Right. And all the terms far enough in the sequence will lie within this epsilon of the limit.
1:08
Okay. So we can we have multiple notations for this.
1:16
We have the notation then and turns to infinity up and equals l we have the arrow notation like this and tends to l.
1:20
So these are the various we can say that the sequence converges to limit.
1:32
We can say that the sequence tends to limit. So there are different ways of expressing this in language and in notation.
1:36
So there is also and by the way, some of you said how is it possible to converge to infinity?
1:46
How is it possible to converge to minus infinity?
1:53
There are actually multiple conventions in the literature for talking about what happens when the series goes to infinity.
1:56
Some people don't use the term Convergys, but we will. OK, so it's important to use the terminology of this course to be consistent.
2:05
Otherwise we won't know who's talking about what. Yes, in the literature, convergence to infinity is not always called convergence.
2:14
Likewise, convergence to minus infinity is not always called convergence.
2:22
But anyway, the sequence again converges to infinity in the extended realign.
2:27
What do I mean by the extended driveline? Who can tell me? What do I mean by the U.S. going?
2:35
Is it just the real loan with Infinity included? Exactly. So it's precisely this, the real line with Infinity included.
2:46
So that's then that's the extended rail line if and only if for all are in the real's.
2:53
There is an end in the natural numbers, such as for all and greater than or equal to end we have and is greater than are we right.
3:00
The limit to the limit as an attempt to infinity of M equals infinity or we ride an arrow infinity.
3:09
In that case, and we have a similar definition for convergence to minus infinity.
3:19
So we say that a sequence converges if it converges either to a real number to infinity or to minus infinity.
3:25
And if the sequence does not converge, we say that it diverges.
3:34
Okay, so that's the vocabulary that we're going to use in this course and.
3:40
Let us unpack this statement, the statement about convergence is best understood by taking the last part,
3:47
by taking the last part first and then working backwards.
3:54
So the last part is the actual limit inequality. So this is the limit inequality.
3:57
We are within Epsilon of the limit the terms and all of them note for all and greater than capitalism and minus still is within Epsilon.
4:04
So and is within Epsilon of the limit.
4:18
So this says that the distance from the to little N in the sequence to the limit should be less than Epsilon.
4:22
That's what the limit inequality says. Now the next bit we have here is for all little and greater than CapitaLand,
4:31
and that means that following there should be some point capital after which all the terms lit and in the sequence are within the limit.
4:40
It's not enough for just some of these points to be within Epsilon of the limit or the term starting from the end term.
4:51
CapitaLand should be within Epsilon of the limit.
5:01
And then we have another part of this definition for all.
5:06
Epsilon greater than zero for all, epsilon greater than zero.
5:14
So this is basically saying no matter what the value of Epsilon pick, however tiny,
5:18
we will still be able to find some value of capital n such that all the terms
5:27
to the right of and in that sequence are within excellent over the limit.
5:32
Any questions of this. Any questions on this?
5:38
You guys are very quiet, is that because it's all very clear? How do you why you got news for Absolom, yes.
5:58
That's right, how do you pick a value for Epsilon? How do you pick a value for Epsilon?
6:06
This should work for all epsilons. Right.
6:10
So in order to prove that something converges, it should converge for an arbitrary epsilon for any real, well, positive.
6:14
Just a second positive epsilon. Yeah. So you don't just prove it for.
6:25
For a specific Absolom, you prove it for all Epsilon's, OK?
6:31
Does that answer your question? Thank you.
6:37
OK, so that's very, very important.
6:41
You are not proving it for a particular absolom, this definition only works if you can get arbitrarily close to the limit.
6:44
So it only works if you allow Epsilon to be an arbitrary, positive rule.
6:51
Okay, so you need to prove this result for an arbitrary positive, real.
6:57
Any other questions? Dos, Absolon, have to always be an integer or can it be a like a float?
7:03
No, no, no. The Epsilon doesn't need to be an integer.
7:14
The Epsilon is a real number. But notice that nowhere in the definition do I say that that the epsilon is an integer.
7:19
No, the epsilon can be a floating point number. Right.
7:28
So it can be a real non integer real. Yep.
7:32
So I'm not saying that Epsilon is a natural. No, I am saying that Capital N is a natural number and some authors don't.
7:35
There are alternative definitions were the capital N is not required to be a natural number.
7:46
Right. So that's something to bear in mind. So were we have an in capital N and in basically natural numbers.
7:54
Some authors don't do that. Some authors just pick a real N.
8:02
Does that answer your question? Yeah, thank you. OK, so Epsilon is not does not have to be a natural number at all.
8:09
Any other questions? If we if we had an episode on those less than one,
8:21
what what is the natural number and the price is still less than Absolom that like oppose this slow because you can't choose,
8:28
there has to be greater than zero zero.
8:37
Well, I think the capital nd.
8:42
There has to be. This is where I find it slightly confusing at this notation that we're using the slide,
8:48
so I think the capital N includes Zeira in our standard notation unless we use CapitaLand plus.
8:58
Unless we use doo doo doo, see this, we have this notation before we've used capital and glass here.
9:07
Yeah, do you see this? So that's four, one, two, three, four, five and so on.
9:22
Whereas this okay, it depends on whether we are mathematician or computer scientists.
9:26
So natural numbers may include zero or may not include zero. Right.
9:32
So that's important. Which convention I prefer to write and with zero to say that it includes zero and
9:37
plus to say that it does not include zero I think by default will do include zero.
9:46
I think by default we do include zero. So it is possible that we start with, but we start number in the terms of the sequence from one.
9:54
You see this? We start numbering the terms of the sequence for one so little and greater than CapitaLand could start with one, right?
10:07
So it could apply to the entire sequence. All right, great.
10:17
Thank you. Yeah, but the definition doesn't really change if you say, well,
10:22
it has to start with two, for example, it doesn't say it doesn't change the definition.
10:27
You are saying that eventually, eventually all the terms will be within Epsilon or felt.
10:32
Right. So whether it's one or zero, it doesn't really change the definition of the logic of the definition.
10:39
But I'll quote her going. Well, if a function is not monotonic and I think sometimes we can have a case that for a specific force of civic,
10:45
it can be like flying us out, can be smaller if long for another one.
11:01
It's going to be larger again. But no, no, no.
11:08
So we need to find yes, I mean, it doesn't have to be monotonic, right?
11:14
But we need to say that at some point all the tools flying to the right of the sequence lie within this belt.
11:19
You cannot break out of this belt. It doesn't have to be monotonic, it could be oscillating, but within this band.
11:28
Within the bounds stipulated by this inequality here, you, me, I need to, like, find another, and that is further than that.
11:38
And I start with that and it does not break support.
11:49
You need to go as far into the sequence as possible as you need so that the inequality holds for all.
11:55
And after this to them. OK.
12:05
So do you mean that like a sequence can be oscillating, but also converging just like E to the minus X times Xanax?
12:10
It can be oscillating and converging. That's right. OK.
12:22
It can approach the limit from one direction, from this direction, or it could be approaching the limit like this.
12:25
It's still Convergys. OK. Yeah.
12:34
And what about functions like one over X that approach limit from both sides?
12:41
We are not talking about functions here, right? We're talking about well, a sequence is a function,
12:46
but it's a special function that is only defined for for natural numbers, for positive natural numbers.
12:51
So we're only talking about going to the limit as as intense to infinity right now.
12:59
We're not talking about approaching a limit from different directions as yet.
13:05
So we'll talk about it when we come to general functions, not just sequences.
13:11
OK, you. All right, so.
13:18
So here are some examples of sequences.
13:25
So could you tell me whether these sequences converge to a limit, converge to infinity, converge to minus infinity or diverge?
13:29
What about the first one? Power to infinity, to infinity.
13:41
What about the second one? Minus Infinity Villages to minus infinity.
13:50
What about the third one diverges just so growth without bounds, but it always jumps between negative and positive values and that growth.
13:58
Therefore, the sequence diverges throughout so it doesn't converge to anything.
14:09
It just oscillates like this.
14:13
So we just because it's oscillate like this, if we pick the epsilon, which is small enough, the definition is not satisfied.
14:16
So it's gorgeous. So so how do we prove that something converges?
14:24
So our definition of convergence tells us how to prove that the sequence converges to a real number, right to a limit.
14:32
L someone gives us a positive absolute right.
14:39
So any positive epsilon? We have no control of that value.
14:43
We don't pick up soon something the epsilon is imposed on us from outside.
14:47
It needs to be an arbitrary, absolute. And for that specific epsilon,
14:52
we have then to find an actual number capital N and demonstrate that the limit inequality holds for all a little bit greater than CapitaLand.
14:57
So it may be helpful to think of the person who gives us this epsilon as a refuser.
15:09
So it's someone who's challenging us saying can you get this close of the limit?
15:16
Can you actually guarantee that you are this close of the limit? We say, yeah, maybe we can, but we need to pick this and for that to happen.
15:20
And then they say, actually, can you get even closer?
15:27
We say yes, but we need to pick a larger end and we demonstrate how we pick N capital N on the basis of this given absolute.
15:29
Okay, so we need to be able to do that. So Capital N does depend on the absolute.
15:38
Okay, so we are basically acting as a verifier.
15:45
Right. That in future tells us, can you,
15:50
can you guarantee that you will eventually get this close of the Epsilon and we then as a verifier try to basically show that indeed we can.
15:52
Okay. In particular, you cannot first determine the value of N without capitaland without being given an absolute right.
16:01
The value of capital and does depend on the epsilon. So we can think of capital N as being a function of the choice of Absolom.
16:09
And we can similarly formulate procedures for how we can prove convergence of the sequence to infinity or minus infinity.
16:19
So let us see this in action. Let's consider the sequence one over and that is one a half a third, quarter a fifth and so on.
16:28
So who can tell me the limit of the sequence? What what does the sequence dentine?
16:40
What does it converge to? So it can go just to zero, so we take little L to be zero.
16:45
So we are now going to prove that this sequence converges to zero.
16:54
So the game is to find a value of capital n for whatever value of that person is chosen.
16:59
Capital represents the point after which all and will be within Epsilon of the limit.
17:05
So the smaller the value of absolutely chosen, the further to the right we will have to go to achieve this.
17:11
Thus the larger the value of capital and that we will have to choose.
17:18
So suppose the refuser gives us a specific absolute zero point two eight.
17:22
Right. So can we can we get within this epsilon of the limit?
17:29
Well, the limit is zero, so we just plug in zero for the limit and then we proceed from the limit inequality.
17:37
We basically write down the limit inequality. Well, we write down what N is.
17:46
So it's actually one over in that is actually zero.
17:51
So our limit inequality becomes this with this given Epsilon and as a consequence,
17:56
the little N has to be greater than three point five seven one for the little N has to be greater than three point five seven one four.
18:07
So.
18:18
So this states that's for and greater than three point five seven, the function one over N will be less than zero point twenty eight from the limit.
18:20
So are we done yet? Have we proved that the sequence converges?
18:31
Now, really, it's a big night. Well, I think so.
18:36
What are the problems with this one? No, I think we should in general, too, that.
18:41
OK, so we need to prove it for an arbitrary epsilon. That's right.
18:48
So we need to prove it for an arbitrary Absolon also. Which capital and do we pick?
18:52
A. Yeah, which is what? For four, exactly.
19:00
So there are these two problems. So the.
19:08
And needs to be a natural number, so we we take the ceiling of three point five seven one four and so on, so any cause for satisfies this requirement.
19:17
And we are further required to ensure that all other points to the right and in the sequence are also within zero point to eight of the limit,
19:30
not just a capital N, but everything further to the right in the sequence.
19:40
And we know that to be true by this inequality, because we have shown this to be true for basically all children for all and greater than the capital.
19:44
And so we are good there. However. However, however, we need to prove this not for a single value of absolute.
19:58
We need to prove this for an arbitrary, absolute right and we can see that this is likely to be a function of.
20:11
So we apply the limited equality again. So the liberty and equality, the limited equality is is this year.
20:21
Now, Epsilon is just some variable fixed variable.
20:31
So we can rewrite the limited equality, we can rewrite it as this.
20:35
Right in our specific case. So it's actually this why is it this well.
20:44
And this one over in L is zero, but it is positive, so this thing here on the left becomes what does it become?
20:56
What does the thing on the left become? Just a just one over and without the Modula sign, right, it becomes just one over end without the Modula side.
21:09
So we have this inequality, which is equivalent to this inequality, which is just saying that N little N is greater than one overexplain.
21:27
So which capitaland do we pick? We pick the ceiling of this value.
21:37
Does everybody know what the ceiling is? To close this larger hole, no, it's basically the.
21:42
Smallest integer that is greater than or equal to a given real number.
21:56
Right. So we have already taken the ceiling when we came up with four, but now we have done this for an arbitrary, absolute.
22:05
You see that we we now have done this for an arbitrary absolom.
22:13
So that's very good. So now we are done. Now, whatever value of absolute we're given, we can find a value of capital then using this function.
22:18
And we have done so. And indeed we're using the function notation here to indicate that Capital N is indeed a function of epsilon.
22:28
OK, any questions on this so far? So would you say the ceiling function was again, OK?
22:40
So look up ceiling in Wikipedia, so let me perhaps look it up.
22:50
And Wikipedia is a great resource for things like this.
22:54
So let me let me have the mathematical ceiling.
22:58
So what does Wikipedia tell us about this?
23:06
So. This is the precise definition, so when in doubt, it's always a good idea to look this up so.
23:12
Floor and ceiling functions, the two functions are related. So the floor function is the function.
23:25
I'm reading the first paragraph that takes as input a real number X and gives us output the greatest integer less than or equal to X.
23:32
And that's denoted by these kind of brackets, by these kind of brackets open at the top, close to the bottom.
23:42
So the ceiling function maps X to the least integer greater than or equal to X,
23:51
and it is denoted by brackets which are close to the top and open at the bottom.
23:57
Do you guys have any questions on this? No.
24:05
Okay, so that's that I think there were a few questions in the chat, so let me quickly look at the chat.
24:13
On the square brackets symbol for G.F. function rather than Cele, what's the function?
24:25
In this context, we're using them as a symbol for sale.
24:38
Does the existence of ND basically prove it, the existence of any such that the limited equality is satisfied proofs convergence?
24:42
Yes, if we can find such capital in, then we can prove convergence.
24:53
Okay, sir, the question I just want the proof as a whole.
24:58
Yes. So, you know, we assume that the inequality holds and then proved like you can find any n is that like a
25:05
valid proof because you've made the assumption that it's true and then show that it's true.
25:15
OK, we didn't assume. That inequality held right, we didn't assume that inequality held, so notice that there is a double implication here.
25:20
Right. Notice that there is a double implication here, so we didn't cheat.
25:35
So it's important to look at the slight. All we have really said here, all we have really said is that our limit inequality, which is this.
25:40
Yeah, the limit inequality, if and only if so we're saying it is equivalent to this inequality and greater than one over Absolom.
25:54
Because we can actually go and see that this inequality holds by picking a suitable capital n we guarantee by this direction of the arrow,
26:07
by this direction of the arrow, that the limit inequality holds.
26:20
Right, we are guaranteeing that the limit inequality holds by guaranteeing this.
26:26
And we guarantee this by picking a suitable capital in. Right.
26:34
So we are proving effectively that the limited equality holds, we we're saying,
26:39
look, we can find such a capital N that will make the limits and equality hold.
26:44
Does that answer your question? Yes, thank you.
26:49
OK, that's what we are doing here. That's what we're doing.
26:54
OK, so we have shown how to prove convergence.
27:04
How do you prove divergence? How do you prove that minus one to the power of one that that sequence?
27:11
How do you prove? That that sequence diverges any ideas.
27:21
You can choose a small Absolon, yes, and then it will never be that close yet, so absolutely.
27:31
So we can pick a specific epsilon in the previous example.
27:41
We have to show that the limited equality for all epsilon, right.
27:45
For an arbitrary absolom. Now we just need a counterexample.
27:49
Now we just need a specific episode for which we can show that the limited equality can never hold.
27:54
Right. So we prove by contradiction, right.
28:00
We prove by contradiction. We first assume that the sequence does converge to help.
28:04
Right. Then for every epsilon greater than zero, we must be able to pick a capital n such that the limited equality holds.
28:10
Now, since this must hold for every episode that we can pick a particular specific absolute and let us pick Epsilon equal to one.
28:20
So we pick absolute equal to one. Right. So when we pick Epsilon equal to one.
28:30
So now we consider only the even terms of the sequence.
28:36
We consider only the terms or.
28:42
Right, as a consequence, but it doesn't matter.
28:47
So it must hold for good and for even terms of the sequence, it must hold for even terms of the sequence greater than capitaland.
28:50
Right. So we have said, OK, there is a specific capital N, and we now consider that even in terms of the sequence, these ones.
28:59
Right, for the even terms of the sequence, this guy becomes one right, because minus one to an even power is one.
29:11
So we have this four hour limit inequality which can be rewritten like this, which is equivalent to saying that zero is less than L is less than two.
29:22
Does everybody agree with what I wrote in this light, or do you guys find this controversial?
29:35
It should be an exact quantity, right? A limit is an exact quantity.
29:45
So we are saying that there is some. Yeah. The limit to which this sequence converges.
29:51
We don't know what it is, but there is some like that, and we have found that this animal must lie within this open into.
29:59
Right, so Al Jazeera is less than L and L is less than two.
30:12
And you have the questions of this. Why do we pick an even number for a reason?
30:19
OK, the reason I picked the even number, even terms of the sequence is because I want to consider the old terms of the sequence as well.
30:28
And I should show that that we get incompatible, incompatible conclusions.
30:37
So one said that our that our limit should be within one range, one interval.
30:45
And when we consider the terms, we find that it must lie in a completely different interval, which doesn't intersect with this one.
30:53
OK, the contradiction is because we have minus one and one, minus one and one, minus one and one.
31:03
So I'm checking what's happening in the vicinity of those minus ones and I'm checking what's happening in the vicinity of those ones.
31:08
That's why I split up, split up the proof in these two parts. Does that answer your question?
31:16
I support alternating series that we always have to consider the two extremes, you don't know,
31:23
maybe you can just prove maybe you could just if it converges, if it just does this with constant amplitude, it diverges.
31:30
But if it does this. It may well converge.
31:40
Yeah, yeah. So for this specific case, it's straightforward for me to split it into the odd and even terms right for this case,
31:47
let me see what let's see what I have done here.
31:57
Let's see what I have done here. So I've considered the even terms and I have concluded that this must be the case.
32:00
So our limit must lie somewhere between zero and two.
32:09
Right. Exclusive, excluding zero and excluding two.
32:13
So now let's consider the old terms. Let's get to the OK, to the terms now for these terms, minus one to an old power will be minus one.
32:18
So our limits in equality for these terms will give me this.
32:30
Which implies that Israel is less than zero.
32:36
Can l be simultaneous with less than zero and greater than zero? Oh, no.
32:43
So we have arrived at a contradiction, the two inequalities that we have derived contradict each other.
32:53
Therefore, our assumption that this sequence converges to a limit must be false.
33:00
OK, on that one.
33:08
I think I agree that actually we have already proved that a can work to a specific number, but what if we convert to 21 minus infinity?
33:11
What if it converges to what? Sorry if you are not guilty?
33:24
Well, we consider that next. So have we proved that they said Vergis.
33:29
Are we there yet? As you know, we're not right because we need to show that it doesn't converge to infinity or minus infinity.
33:36
So we still need to show that it doesn't convert infinity or minus infinities.
33:49
How do we go about it? So let's look at the definitions. Let us it's always good when you are proving the stuff.
33:54
It's always good to copy the definition. So I just copied them there.
34:01
Right. So I just copied those definitions. So now if indeed the first definition we pick the little are to be two,
34:05
if we pick the little order to be two in the first definition, we know that no matter what N.
34:17
And will be less than or equal to two. Right, so we can never have this.
34:26
Therefore, the sequence does not converge to infinity and to prove that it does not converge to minus infinity, we think are equal to minus two.
34:34
So this sequence does not converge to a limited L does not converge to infinity, does not converge to minus infinity.
34:47
It does not converge. Therefore, it must diverge. And we are done.
34:55
Write, we can write code and write them and strand them, which means which was to be demonstrated QED.
35:01
And since QED is a bit pretentious, people often use instead of QAD the how most simple it may be filled with black or it may not be filled.
35:10
So it's regardless. That's how simple. It just corresponds to two different latex symbols.
35:21
Right. So we're done with the proof. We're done with the truth.
35:28
Xingjian, does it answer your question? Yes, but I'm still a little bit confused about the proof of.
35:36
It has now come to an end now. Well, let's look at this, right?
35:45
The sequence converges to infinity if for all little or there is such a natural no capital N.
35:51
That's for all little and greater than or equal to this capital n we have this inequality hold.
36:02
Right, so where greater? So if you give me so this is the sequence.
36:11
Right. So this is the sequence doing its stuff.
36:16
We are saying that it converges to infinity, that we can set a bar over here and the sequence will reach this bar.
36:20
I'm just saying set the bar at two. The sequence never breaches this bar.
36:27
So we have failed to, for example. The second line where you pick our minds to should be a big all equals two minus a minus two, or is it?
36:37
Yes, you're absolutely right. That's a typo. It should say a and greater than or equal to minus two.
37:00
And let me correct that in the in the slides, actually.
37:09
Let me correct that in the slides.
37:17
Let me I'm not going to waste time now, I'm just going to write down, but there is a typo political correctness in this upload.
37:21
The new version of this slides, by the way, today with corrections. Thank you very much for supporting that.
37:28
OK, there is a raised hand as well. Can I ask a question or ask if we have a definition for diverges?
37:48
Diverges is if it doesn't converge to a limit, if it doesn't converge to infinity and it doesn't converge to minus infinity.
37:59
That's the definition for divergence. And this definition is here.
38:07
Oh, so like, if none of the above cases are true, let's let's just look with definitions.
38:11
It's always good to be precise.
38:17
So we say the sequence converges to a limit, blah blah blah, converges to infinity, blah blah blah, converges to minus infinity, blah, blah, blah.
38:19
The sequence converges if it converges either to a real number or to infinity or to minus infinity.
38:28
That's Convergys. And the sequence diverges if it does not converge.
38:35
So this is a bit like law, you know, we need to be very precise with definitions when we are doing formal mathematics.
38:45
So a sequence either converge or diverge the sequence, either convergence or divergence by the law of excluded middle.
38:52
Yeah, there is no alternative. Right.
39:01
Yeah, in this in this terminology, in this terminology.
39:05
I have a question, you know, when it comes to the definition of convergence with infinity and negative,
39:15
infinity is the ability for and is greater than or equal to end district versus when you have that with a limit.
39:22
It's not strict. Yeah, I was thinking about that because that's how it was in Anabasis notes.
39:30
I think I. I don't think that if you change the strictness, it matters, but I think you just stick with what it says in the notes.
39:37
Yeah, but it's a good point. I think the definition will still work. Right, if you if you say for all little and greater than CapitaLand.
39:52
Right, I think the definition will still work. I don't think it has a material effect on the definitions, but that's a good point.
40:02
But let's stick with what's written in the notes. Does that answer your question?
40:13
Thank you. Okay. I don't think if you replaced in that specific inequality greater than or equal with strict inequality,
40:21
I don't think this will change the meaning of the definition. But let's not let's not do that because confusion will result.
40:31
Ryan, I think you were raised to really stand I what value for Epsilon to be paying for the odd case?
40:38
Oh, we picked. We picked excellent equal one for both cases, for the people we picked.
40:49
Well, this is this is the order in which we proceeded. We picked excellent first.
41:01
Then we took all the terms greater than well with this excellent by our assumption of convergence to limit,
41:07
because we assumed for a contradiction that we do converge to limit.
41:14
We picked a capital N then we looked at the even terms after the capital and then we
41:18
looked at the odd terms up to the capital n with that Epsilon Epsilon equal to one,
41:24
and we derived the two incompatible inequalities.
41:31
This answer your question. I you until you have your hand raised as well.
41:37
Yeah, I'm concerned about so when you prove that such sequence diverges, converges to Al, we picked absolutely course one.
41:45
And why wouldn't anyone argue that this might converge when we pick another Absolon?
41:55
Oh, I'm just I'm proving divergence, right? I'm not proving convergence.
42:02
So to prove divergence, it's enough for me to say, well, it just doesn't work for this epsilon.
42:07
Therefore, the entire definition of convergence doesn't hold because the definition of convergence
42:12
says the definition of convergence says that it works for every epsilon greater than zero.
42:19
Right? I'm saying no. There is an episode for which it doesn't work. Right.
42:26
So that refutes the entire definition. All right.
42:31
So you're finding a counterexample and finding a counterexample.
42:34
When I was proving convergence, when I was proving convergence, I was proving it for an arbitrary episode.
42:38
I was proving it for an arbitrary episode for all Epsilon's.
42:45
Right. But when I was proving divergence, I was finding a counterexample.
42:51
All right, I understand. Thank you. OK. Ten minute break will resume at 10:00 a.m.
42:57
Okay. Do you want to go for a break? Do want to ask you a question now.
43:07
Let's let's deal with the question and then go for a break. OK, so how how do I pick?
43:15
So how do I pick up effective stuff for the country or how can that be powerful?
43:24
I just guessed that for one, it's not going to work because the sequence oscillates between minus one and one.
43:29
So the amplitude is to. So I picked the I picked half of the amplitude.
43:37
OK, I got that. Thank you. Yeah, because by geometry of the situation,
43:44
I kind of figured out that you cannot be within one of this and you cannot be within and simultaneously be within one of this.
43:48
Do you see what I'm showing? Yeah, you can cannot be simultaneously here and here.
43:57
OK, we resume at 10:00.
44:09
We have looked at how to prove divergence, so we have looked at various proof techniques and yes, so common convergent sequences, right?
44:17
There are there are sequences that converge. So one of own, as we have seen, converges to zero.
44:31
One of our own to the power of see whenever sees a positive, real constant also converges to zero.
44:39
One to the over, two to the power of an also converges to zero one over see the power of an whenever
44:49
sees a real constant with the modulus of C greater than one converges to zero.
45:00
Equivalently, we can write it like so with the modulus of C,
45:08
less than one factorial one over N factorial tends to zero and one over log in dense to zero as well.
45:12
So these are just some common convergent sequences. If in doubt you can check it in Python, you could plot.
45:25
But of course that's not to prove that's a hint.
45:32
But I often use numerical hints before I start proving something.
45:36
So Python is still very helpful, right? Of course, you cannot prove stuff with Python, but you can get a hint by visualising stuff and that's helpful.
45:41
So. Now.
45:52
OK, from these thunder sequences, we can combine new sequences,
45:57
so it's very fortunate that limits for sequences have good what is called compositional properties.
46:03
Right. And you have a question. Yeah, can I ask in the previous example, we got zero less than less than two and minus two less than less than zero,
46:12
and we showed that because they don't match,
46:24
it does not converge infinity, but happens if it overlaps just like by one number, for example, zero less than less than two.
46:27
And the other one is minus one, less than less than one, for example.
46:36
Then it wouldn't work. We would probably need to pick a different absolute.
46:40
Also, they both must have the exact same limit as long as the two, as long as we prove that,
46:44
I mean, they don't have to have the same limits, they don't have to touch. Right.
46:51
As long as it's impossible to be in both simultaneously. We have a contradiction.
46:55
So if it overlaps just a bit, if they overlap just a bit, we would be we would we would fail this proof.
47:01
Are they the entire the entire point of this,
47:08
what was to show that you have two non overlapping intervals and one one one part of the proof says we have to be here, the other we have to be here.
47:11
That's how we arrive at the contradiction. Right. But if they overlapped even at one point.
47:20
What we would have proved, we would have proved that the limit has to be like zero, for instance, so it wouldn't work.
47:26
The proof wouldn't lie here. So we have to find these non overlapping intervals.
47:33
OK, and another question I have is just to clarify this divergence mean conversion, Vin Diesel, or the convergence to infinity is not divergence.
47:40
It's still convergence in our terminology. OK, great convergence to infinity is still convergence.
47:50
OK, but, yes, there's different limits, basically a different kind of convergence,
47:59
so there is convergence to a limit and there is convergence to infinity.
48:06
It's a different kind of convergence. OK, thank you.
48:10
That's the terminology we're currently using. So, OK, so memorise these sequences, OK, memorise them.
48:15
There are six of them, so it will be helpful. But what if we have some weird sequence, which is none of that?
48:26
So what if we have, for example, something like this? How do we prove or how do we find its limit?
48:35
So the answer to that is in combinations of sequences.
48:47
So if we have to sequence this and and be in that convergent A and B respectively, then the sequence lambda and converges to Lambda A,
48:52
the sequence and plus B and converges to A plus B the sequence and minus again converges to A minus B the sequence
49:05
and B and converges to a B and the sequence and of a B converges to A over B provided that B is non-zero.
49:13
Any questions on this very, very important being able to combine different sequences?
49:24
Any questions on this? Be a zero for the last case,
49:33
does it converge to infinity or something then then it's then then we need to do some
49:41
some extra work to work out what it converges to or what it doesn't converge to.
49:50
Yeah. So we can't really say immediately what what it converges to or doesn't converge.
49:58
Yep. Any other questions?
50:06
Still good to go back to the Laslett for just a second. Yeah. I take a photo of this and I'd memorise these.
50:27
Thank you so much. OK, so so we'll need this result, the triangle inequality.
50:51
That's for any real numbers, and B, the modulus A plus B is less than or equal to the sum of modularly of A and B.
51:01
This is known as the triangle inequality. This slide shows how to prove it.
51:13
But I'm probably going to press on. Right, look at this slide, it's useful to know how to prove the triangle inequality.
51:22
I'm just going to use it. So that's another thing to memorise and to to to know.
51:31
It's a very, very useful inequality and comes up with a lot of places in analysis, along with some other inequalities, such as the inequality.
51:37
So. I've just I'm thinking whether I should go through the roof or I'm going to press on, I'm going to press on.
51:49
Can you go through it, like, and make a recording of it? Yes, so let me write that down.
52:01
So proof of. Good quality.
52:08
So for now, I'm suggesting that we with that, we just use it.
52:19
Excuse me, but I think there's a typo.
52:26
Sister Modulars E-Plus be at the square of the modulars of APESMA is letting you go to Modula of E-Plus and be at the mall.
52:28
Oh yes. I'm sorry. So. Positive for Texas record.
52:37
What if only? Oh, sorry, this should not be there.
52:47
Right, this square should not be that. Do you agree with that?
52:55
Oh, yeah, yeah, so if we get rid of the square, this will be fine.
53:05
All right. Am I going to go through the proof? OK, so let us actually look at one of these results.
53:12
There is a question. There is a hunt.
53:19
So as for the llamas that you showed on the previous page, do we need to remember is the llamas and the proof, such as the llamas for the exam?
53:25
So you don't really need to memorise the proofs, but you will be asked to prove stuff in the exam.
53:33
So it's good to know the techniques. OK, thank you. It's good to know the technique.
53:39
So you will be asked. I mean, the proof that you will be asked for in the exam are probably relatively simple, right?
53:43
So we won't give you the most difficult proofs.
53:49
But it's good to know the techniques because you will be asked to prove stuff in the exams, in the exam.
53:52
So here is how we prove that the limit of the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of the limits.
54:00
So we take an absolute greater than zero, right,
54:08
than one than half of this absolutely is also greater than zero since the first sequence converges to a there is an
54:14
end one such that for any and greater than that and one of the limiting inequality with the half of Epsilon holds,
54:23
well, we just replace Epsilon with half of them because this limiting inequality needs to work for an arbitrary positive, real right.
54:33
We can do the same trick with the second inequality. Right.
54:42
And then we end up with this limited inequality. Now, what we're going to do, we're going to pick whichever of the one.
54:46
And then two is larger and we're going to set end to that number.
54:55
So four and greater than capital in both inequalities will hold this inequality and this inequality will hold.
55:00
And for any little and greater than capital, then we will therefore have this.
55:10
Right. So notice how we are rewriting, just rearranging this stuff.
55:18
Well, I'm very sorry this was less than sewn in,
55:25
but is that meant to be a left less than sign on the right hand side, like in between, as they just meant be equals?
55:28
Oh, I'm sorry that that's a typo as well. I'm sorry about that. So first of all, this way should be built right this way and should be in.
55:36
So I'll correct that. Sorry about that. This should be B.M. So whatever I've written.
55:49
Why that should be B.N. and here we have quality, but here we have less than a equals.
55:55
So here we have less than R equals. Yeah, so here we have inequality.
56:02
And. Yes, so correct that to know the correct slides.
56:14
Okay, so that's but the basic idea is this.
56:20
We use the triangle inequality and we end up with these two have epsilon's, which give us an absolute.
56:24
And here we are less than or equal to this thing.
56:30
Reshat. You have a question. Can you briefly please go over why it's less than or equal to largest, less than by triangle by triangle inequality?
56:36
OK, thank you. Yeah, I think the last line should be listed as this because of Epsilon.
56:48
Oh, it should be less than exactly. You're absolutely right.
56:57
In fact, let me let me perhaps let me correct this.
57:04
I think this is correct now. What do you guys think?
57:11
Do you agree with me? I think I'm in agreement.
57:19
Yeah, OK, excellent, so OK, we have proven this result using triangle inequality, a very useful inequality.
57:25
OK, we have the required result that we have the correct inequalities.
57:34
OK, let's look at an example of how we can use these results for combining sequences.
57:40
Why? So the question is, how does this sequence converge to.
57:48
Now we want to translate it into sequences that we know and therefore we divide
57:54
the numerator and denominator by and squared and we end up with this guy here.
57:59
Right. And then what we do, we basically have a ratio of two different sequences.
58:05
And we know we know about ratios so we can investigate the convergence of the denominator of the numerator separately and.
58:12
And so we see that the numerator converges to three, the denominator converges to six, so the entire thing converges to a half.
58:27
Any questions of this? We have worked out what this fairly sophisticated looking sequence converges to.
58:41
Any questions? All right, if there are no questions, will press on.
58:56
So. So far, the definition of a sequence to have illimitable, it's it's useful, but we have to keep guessing what the limit was, right.
59:05
So we basically had to do quite a lot of guessing. We needed to first know what the limit was and then to prove that that was indeed the limit.
59:19
How can we get rid of this guesswork? And another question is, is it possible for sequels to convert to multiple limits?
59:29
So how would you prove that a sequence can only have one limited?
59:40
That's a question to you guys, how can you prove that a sequence can only have one limit,
59:53
assume there's two limits and then reason towards contradiction know so we can prove by contradiction, right.
1:00:00
So we have to limits L1 and L2. Right.
1:00:08
And then we have these two limit inequalities.
1:00:13
This one. And this one. Holding four and one, four and two, then we pick some Máximo up with one and then two.
1:00:17
And we. Actually, consider.
1:00:31
So one of them says that the that the elements of the sequence have to be close to one another,
1:00:38
says that the elements of the sequence have to be close to two.
1:00:47
And we have shown from this we can show that the distance between one and two is less than two thirds of the distance between one and two,
1:00:52
which is clearly a contradiction. OK, that's how you can prove that the limit of the sequence is unique.
1:01:09
OK, that's one way of proving that. And how can we eliminate guessing?
1:01:19
OK, we can introduce a different notion, a different idea of convergence, and that is the idea of the cautious sequence.
1:01:28
So we can have a definition of convergence, a different definition of convergence, which does not explicitly involve a particular limit.
1:01:37
So a sequence is a cautious sequence if and only if for all.
1:01:51
Epsilon greater than zero. There is some capital and in natural numbers such that we're all a little and little m
1:01:58
greater than that capital n we have the distance between An and a m less than Epsilon.
1:02:07
OK, so, so somewhere further out in the sequence, whichever two terms of the sequence we can find,
1:02:17
the distance between these two terms is going to be less than Epsilon per note and are not consecutive terms.
1:02:27
So it may not be sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the preceding term.
1:02:37
For instance, in the sequence of square roots of natural numbers, the consecutive terms become arbitrarily close to each other.
1:02:43
Okay, but it's not a cautious sequence. Because the terms themselves become arbitrarily large.
1:02:51
OK, so that is not a cautious sequence. Any questions and cautious sequences, a new idea?
1:03:00
And a good example, can we have an example?
1:03:11
Yes, in a second, so we'll look at examples. So.
1:03:15
In fact, we have seen lots of examples. Because every sequence that converges to a real number is a cautious sequence.
1:03:21
My question to you guys, if you can prove that. Can you prove that?
1:03:33
Every sequence that converges to a real number is a cautious sequence, how would you prove that?
1:03:41
Reesha. How can you prove it by triangle inequality?
1:03:48
Let's see. Indeed you can. Oh yeah.
1:03:53
So you have a sequence that converges to a limit, right?
1:03:58
Therefore there exists some N1. Such that it's within absolutely over two of that limit.
1:04:05
Now, if we pick a different term, M greater than or equal to one.
1:04:15
Then we have the same inequality, we can take it with Epsilon over two million,
1:04:23
and then we take some and greater than or equal to one then for all and am greater than or equal to nd
1:04:29
we have the distance between XM and XM is going to be equal to the distance between X and minus AI and.
1:04:39
Well, I've just added a note, subtract it a right, I haven't done anything.
1:04:52
I've added A and I've subtracted a. Well, so why do we have both and that's that's a good point, because I think I've made another mistake.
1:04:58
Sorry about this. And also it's the smaller the war tomorrow.
1:05:21
So, so so basically the age should be another.
1:05:26
L am sorry about this. That's my mistake.
1:05:30
So I'm going to correct this right now. So what about triangle inequality?
1:05:51
I think should be smaller, I work for you.
1:06:00
It's not just right. Thank you very much for these corrections.
1:06:05
So we just have here, that's fine, and here we have less than our equals in the triangle inequality,
1:06:14
the actual strict inequality comes here and it comes from here and from here.
1:06:22
Do you guys agree? So this shows that our sequence is a cautious sequence, so basically, in actual fact,
1:06:29
you have already seen examples, quite a lot of examples of cautious sequences.
1:06:40
Brian. Shouldn't it be instead of X and again, because we're talking about the series A, you are quite right again, but I'll correct that later.
1:06:48
OK, so let me just find this out that I made a mistake again.
1:07:03
So I need to correct this.
1:07:10
I'll correct this in the slides and other politically correct slides.
1:07:16
Our politically correct slides, but you get the idea of the proof, right?
1:07:27
You get the idea. Alex, what what's your question about this slight?
1:07:33
The whole truth. Okay, so this strategy here is to use triangle inequality to show that if a sequence.
1:07:52
But let me perhaps correct let me correct the problem.
1:08:00
Let me correct the problem, the slides. So I'll I'll correct them right now, actually, the entire idea of the truth.
1:08:05
So the basic idea of this truth.
1:08:17
Yes, to use the triangle inequality to show by definition that a convergence sequence,
1:08:24
a sequence that converges to a No l is actually a cautious sequence.
1:08:32
And for that, we use the definition of convergence.
1:08:38
We pick an absolute over two and we pick a capital n capital and one such that we are within Epsilon over two of the limit.
1:08:42
Then we take we take some M.
1:08:57
Which is greater than N and we also have, but by the same definition of convergence, we have this limit inequality hold for that.
1:09:01
And now it so happens that for all and.
1:09:11
Whether they're equal to Ed. We have this we have the we have this definition of.
1:09:19
So, okay, Miller, so the point is not about consecutive terms and m don't have to be consecutive, the terms are getting closer together,
1:09:35
but this is stronger than just consecutive terms,
1:09:47
because if you look at the definition of the cautious sequence, which is here, if you look at that definition.
1:09:51
Then you will see that and Emma non-consecutive.
1:10:00
We know that this is because instead of picking Epsilon, we picked Epsilon over to right.
1:10:11
Remember that in this in this term, in this in this definition, the four convergence in the definition for convergence.
1:10:19
Where it says. Where it says.
1:10:32
For all epsilon greater than zero, I might as well take Epsilon over to.
1:10:38
Right, absolutely. Which is also greater than zero, so I can find such capital in that.
1:10:44
The limits and equality works with Epsilon over two. OK.
1:10:56
That's what we have here. That's what we have here.
1:11:02
Now. Here is an interesting example, here is a sequence that converges to a real number and is therefore caution.
1:11:09
OK, so we pick a one equal to one. Ryan, you have a question.
1:11:20
Yes, does it make a difference if we take Epsilon instead of Epsilon over two?
1:11:28
Yeah, because we need to then have Epsilon with two plus Epsilon over to.
1:11:32
Right, we need this to be absolute. Well, this definition, we are trying to do this definition here, right?
1:11:37
What we need to prove this inequality with absolute minimum.
1:11:45
So that's why we picked these two inequalities with Epsilon over two, because when we add them together, we end up with absolute.
1:11:48
Thank you. Yep. That's our strategy. That's how we structured the proof.
1:11:58
Now, I'm going to show you a very strange example, a very strange example that is worth memorising.
1:12:04
I have a particular sequence. They one is going to be set to one and and plus one is going to be set to a half and plus two over an.
1:12:11
Does anybody have Python? Does anybody have faith?
1:12:25
I've got snake. So can you check what this thing converges to which no.
1:12:33
If you give me a. So let me show you how to do this.
1:12:48
So I start with this and then I do this.
1:12:59
And what do you see here? What do I see here?
1:13:07
I mean, this is not a goof. Yeah, I'm not ruling anything out.
1:13:20
I'm just playing with numbers. Square rooted square root.
1:13:24
Two is square root. Two, rational or irrational.
1:13:27
Irrational, irrational. What about the terms of the sequence, are they irrational or are they irrational?
1:13:33
I think it's rational for your rational, despite all rational.
1:13:42
And look, we have a sequence of rational terms, right?
1:13:47
A cautious sequence, right. But it's limit.
1:13:53
So if we don't think of it as a as a sequence in real, it is a sequence of rational numbers.
1:13:58
Right. A sequence taking values on the set of rational numbers.
1:14:07
Right. If we think of it like that. Right.
1:14:12
Think of it like that. Think of it as a sequence of rational numbers.
1:14:16
The limit is not an rational number. The limit is somewhere outside the set.
1:14:19
We have a cautious sequence which can look this.
1:14:26
But the it's in a different set, the legal limit, right, therefore, because rational numbers behave in this strange way.
1:14:32
It is pretty cool, isn't it? We say that rational numbers are not khushi complete.
1:14:44
Right. Rational numbers, because it's possible to have a cautious sequence which converges to something outside the set.
1:14:50
We basically say that rational numbers are not complete.
1:15:00
What about real numbers? Are real numbers a complete.
1:15:05
I believe, yes. OK, can we prove that?
1:15:13
Maybe so we can prove that, OK, this is the definition of a completeness,
1:15:20
a subset A is set to be complete if any corsia sequence in A converges to a limit.
1:15:28
Very importantly, converges to a limit in a Convergys to a limit in a so irrational number can be represented
1:15:34
as a fraction where the numerator and denominator a Overbey would be is non-zero.
1:15:45
That's what a rational number is.
1:15:51
So real numbers, every rational number is a real number, but not every real number is a rational number because, for example, the square root of two.
1:15:54
That's a famous proof. Find the proof that the square root of two is not a rational number.
1:16:09
It's a pretty proof, simple, but very pretty. It's approved by contradiction.
1:16:13
OK, any questions on this, so we have found that Rationals are not corsia complete, OK?
1:16:21
This means that the rational numbers are not Koshy complete because not all kosher sequences of rational numbers have limits in queue.
1:16:30
In contrast, the set of real numbers is kosher, complete and will prove that later.
1:16:37
So this is the definition of completeness, any cautious sequence in a converges to a limit in a.
1:16:46
That is causing a complete. Okay, so what about hole number, if we only have hole no yes equals.
1:16:56
OK, well, if if. So that's a good question.
1:17:11
It doesn't it depends how you define division in other operations.
1:17:19
So you are on natural numbers scoresheet, complete or not?
1:17:25
So maybe you can answer this question on actual numbers, a complete.
1:17:33
Maybe not for number two, not because it's like this because.
1:17:42
They could not be closer to. Entirely possible, maybe are made.
1:17:48
So why don't you guys tell me next time, why don't you guys tell me next time?
1:17:55
Why don't you guys tell me next time? That's an interesting question.
1:18:05
There's a subset, a set to be complete, if any, causal sequence in a convergence to eliminate.
1:18:11
Right, a subsidy is set to be cautiously complete if any cautious sequence in a converges to a limit today.
1:18:19
And then we basically saw that rational numbers are not complete, not quite yet complete,
1:18:27
but we can actually show that real numbers are caution complete and will prove that later.
1:18:35
Kate. So is anybody still confused by rational, irrational and real numbers?
1:18:43
You need to look that up again. Go back to the previous slide for a second, please.
1:18:52
The definition. Then one more before this.
1:18:58
Thank you. But what's the use of saying that a causal sequence is complete if it just converges, isn't the aim to find where the sequence converges?
1:19:08
Not so, not this sequence is complete. This set, this subset of or is complete if any cautious sequence in that set converges to a limit.
1:19:32
It's not a cautious sequence that is complete, a set in which the sequence can look carefully at the definition.
1:19:43
The city is set to be complete if any quartier sequence in a converges to a limit.
1:19:54
OK, thank you. OK. So.
1:20:02
Oshi sequences can be defined for other stuff such as vectors, right?
1:20:10
So, for example, we will see in linear algebra the course that you do in the second term, that vector spaces that you consider.
1:20:15
There are also corsia complete in the same sense.
1:20:24
But this is just a just kind of a quick announcement.
1:20:28
Another very useful way of proving. That a sequence converges is by sandwiching it between two convergent sequences that converge to the same limit,
1:20:33
and we have this so-called sandwich theorem, let's l.n. and unbe sequences and let l be a real number such that both these sequences converge to
1:20:47
that real number and so close that the third sequence we have this for the for the third sequence,
1:20:58
that it is basically eventually sandwiched between these two sequences, then that sandwich sequence has limited L as well.
1:21:06
Let's look at an example of this consider sequence signed and divided by Ed.
1:21:20
Side and divided by Ed. We can sandrich the sequence.
1:21:28
Like this. Between two sequences, minus one over Orgeron and one over in those two sequences, what do they converge to?
1:21:39
Zero zero. Therefore, this sequence must converge to.
1:21:55
Hopefully, there is also zero. Exactly, and this is what it looks like, you can plug this in Python quite quickly.
1:22:04
Yeah, this is what it looks like. Right, that is a sandwiched sequence,
1:22:12
and then you have to prove that they're like the two sequences are also like less than the apology also holds the two sequences like.
1:22:21
You need to prove this. Yeah, so you need to prove each side of that, right?
1:22:32
Yes. And that follows from this. Yeah. Bullets from the range of side.
1:22:37
You just divide the territory. Yep. That's how you prove it.
1:22:41
Certain. You just divide everything by hand and then you end up with this guy and you have the sandwich, the.
1:22:46
OK, and we have this kind of situation that now the proof of the sandwich theorem.
1:22:56
Users. That's OK.
1:23:04
We will we will continue with the proof of the sandwich theorem. On Wednesday.
1:23:15
OK, is it possible to have these slides because the slides we have don't contain anything on the sandwich there, they sort of stopped before that.
1:23:22
OK, so I will upload the slides on Cintia and materials right now.
1:23:29
OK, thank you. You can also upload to the corrected sites.
1:23:34
Yeah. So I will replace the slides that are currently there with this set of slides.
1:23:38
OK, thank you very much for joining this lecture and have a lovely week see on Wednesday.
1:23:48
Thank you. Thank you. Take a.
1:23:56
So I ought to ask a question, I'll go on, you know how you told us six rules, like six types of common convergent sequences.
1:24:01
I mean, this is way back, yeah.
1:24:11
I can't really see them right now, but these ones I do get to remember.
1:24:18
Is it OK if you just understand them and just use them or do we have to remember them by like you used rule number five?
1:24:23
No, no, no, you don't. You don't need to you don't need to remember like that at school is something that we can just remember to just understand it.
1:24:29
And that'll be exactly. Just to just know that one over N Factorial converges.
1:24:37
Right. That's all you need to know. Two to zero. Yeah.
1:24:43
Thank you so much. No problem. Yeah, sorry, I have another question go on.
1:24:51
Completeness. What does it mean to say, like any Choshi sequence in a minute, like the sequence is defined by TOMASSINI or.
1:24:57
Yes. A sequence of terms in a. Needs to have a limit in a.
1:25:06
Right, we saw an example where we had the sequence which was defined in cue this sequence here.
1:25:14
But the limit wasn't in queue at all. The limit was a real number, but it was an irrational number.
1:25:24
So they set up rational numbers is not a complete.
1:25:32
But in plus one 1/2 times and plus two over in is not exactly a definition of a rational number three, because it's like a plus inside.
1:25:37
So it's just. But what about the closure properties of rational numbers?
1:25:48
So two over again is a rational number and is a rational number.
1:25:55
So the sum of two rational numbers is a rational number.
1:26:00
It's multiplied by a rational number. Irrational number multiplied by a rational number is a rational number.
1:26:04
OK, I understand. I didn't know about the closure thing yet, because if you add to rational, if you are to fractions, you get a fraction.
1:26:12
Yeah, if you have actual numbers, it's irrational because multiply that by a fraction.
1:26:21
It's going to be a rational number. OK, thank you.
1:26:26
Yeah. And you have questions. How are you finding the employees, are you enjoying the machines, are they difficult, are they easy?
1:26:31
I haven't had any yet, you haven't had any you email me.
1:26:47
I haven't had any either either other people who haven't had it in L.A., could you e-mail me?
1:26:54
Yeah. Did someone actually have amortise. You know.
1:27:01
Paul Hitcher argued that you'd like to begin this week.
1:27:08
They begin this week. Yeah. So the first tutorial session will happen from today onwards.
1:27:14
OK, well that's fine. That's fine. Yeah.
1:27:21
That's good. All right, any other questions?
1:27:27
Because you discovered a convergence, this guessing and how that leads to the KHUSHI sequence.
1:27:42
OK, so let's go to the definition of convergence. Let's go to the definition of convergence.
1:27:50
So this definition of convergence, it has a parameter l the limit.
1:27:58
Do you agree? In order to apply this definition, we need to know what the limit is.
1:28:07
If I give you an arbitrary sequence, can you immediately tell me what the limits of that sequence is?
1:28:15
I mean, you can put some it's one voicebox. Yeah, if it's if it's an easy sequence, you can plot it, you can kind of tell.
1:28:26
Yes, it looks like it's converging to zero. But look at this sequence here.
1:28:34
Look at this sequence here. Look at the sequence, the one in this example.
1:28:41
Look at the sequence. Can you tell me what the limit is by looking at the sequence?
1:28:54
No, no, I'm telling you, it's square root of two, but but it's pretty difficult to actually guess that.
1:29:03
Yeah, so but you would in order to apply that definition,
1:29:13
in order to prove that it converges to something you would need you would need to use the fact that it converges to.
1:29:17
So it converges to the square root of two. But what if you don't know that.
1:29:28
Right. This is where guessing is involved in this kind of.
1:29:33
Well, how can you guess the limit? It's not always possible.
1:29:37
So if you look at the definition of cautious sequence, this definition here, you will see that it doesn't mention the limit at all.
1:29:41
It doesn't mention the limit at all. Do you see that so basically what is equivalent to the Convergys, to all of it?
1:29:57
Well, it's the other way around, right? Every sequence that converges to a real number.
1:30:13
Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm going to use also now.
1:30:20
So now what to do about it so we can find, for example, sequences that are not sequences that limit to a real number.
1:30:26
So why don't you tell me next time whether such sequences exist or not?
1:30:35
OK, perfect. OK, so that's that's that's an extra piece of homework, if you like.
1:30:40
Are that cautious sequences that do not converge to a real number?
1:30:48
Right. How can you answer? Yeah, I look into it.
1:30:58
Thank you. OK, so one more question about companies ask why is the mathematical significance of having A Subset B complete?
1:31:02
Well, basically, if you consider a set right and you see the sequences in the set, it's a kind of it's a polite, well behaved set that is complete.
1:31:13
Right. That that whose Kosheh sequences converge to a limit within the set.
1:31:28
Right. So, in fact, in fact, if if if if the sex is not complete, right.
1:31:35
If a set is not complete, then then you get you can get problems.
1:31:49
Right. You expect you can start reasoning about the limits, but the limits doesn't live in the set at all.
1:31:56
Right. So it's not a well behaved situation.
1:32:03
So with real numbers, you know that a cautious sequence has a limit in the real numbers.
1:32:08
But with Rationals, you don't. So these kind of closure properties, these completeness properties are very useful because,
1:32:17
for instance, you can rely in the proof on the completeness property.
1:32:27
You can rely in a proof of some important fact that the limit actually exists in the same set.
1:32:30
OK, so so it's more like. Using it as proof, but using like photo proof, and it's something that we are not really concerned for stitches.
1:32:39
Well, you will be using this in further proofs, right?
1:32:50
But it's an important property of the set. Khushi completeness is an important property of a set, and it's well behaved in this.
1:32:55
Right. You will find in mathematics that there are other completeness properties such as the deck and completeness.
1:33:02
Right. So set that lack completeness. Property properties.
1:33:08
There are it's not just for completeness. There are multiple kinds of completeness can be problematic to deal with.
1:33:13
Right. Because they, they can, you can, you can have paradoxical, almost paradoxical behaviour right.
1:33:21
Where you have a sequence and then the sequence doesn't have limited the set. Right.
1:33:28
That's a strange, strange behaviour. So you cannot count on the limited living in the set, for example.
1:33:32
I mean, it's important in many areas of computer sites such as computability.
1:33:39
Right. Computability relies on completeness properties because the limit to my house computer science significance,
1:33:44
it could be, for example, an integral or something like that.
1:33:52
Right. To expect the limit to exist within the set.
1:33:56
But there are other completeness properties that are completeness properties that you encounter in order theory.
1:34:00
There are completeness properties you encounter in topology. Right.
1:34:06
There are several important completeness properties that are very important in the mathematical sense to silence your question.
1:34:10
I understand. So it's just like being assured that.
1:34:19
And no, like to be under the same success, that's something that it's always useful that competition and stuff improve.
1:34:23
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Any other questions?
1:34:31
No more questions. All right, guys, I'll see you on Wednesday.
1:34:42
Thank you. Thank you.
1:34:48
