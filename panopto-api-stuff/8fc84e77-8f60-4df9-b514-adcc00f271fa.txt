There we are. Can I get a sign from somebody that you can hear me with?
0:18
Canadian accent Thank you very much. Good. So we started yesterday, also not yesterday, the day before yesterday with the discussion of offsets.
0:23
And we had seen operations that define us at some of these operations have to be postulated as being sets, said the just one.
0:39
So you can clearly argue that because they are dealing with just what you create is set as well.
0:49
The what we do now is we continue a little bit more on the operations of the surge and I'll move into relations,
0:55
which is a particular kind of a subset of the Cartesian product.
1:01
OK, first of all, I want to discuss with you the concept of what is a partition.
1:08
Yeah. So if I have a set s here, I can call the the Group of Subsets A1 Opta and so that's a group of subsets.
1:13
I just called the partition. If first of all, each of these subsets is not empty.
1:26
So it has to pick some elements of S together, they collect the whole of S and so the union of all these subsets together forms exactly the setters.
1:33
And I want that these subsets in the in the list there are pairwise disjoint.
1:47
So that means that if the intersection between all these sets pairwise is empty and I have this abbreviated notation for a union over and elements,
1:55
which is subscript and superscript notation there.
2:08
So I it ranges from one to end in the.
2:11
OK, me, yeah, I used that petition to petition principle to show the what it's called the pigeonhole principle.
2:22
There are many different names for this particular thing. One of them is related to two shoemakers and nails.
2:33
The one that's commonly known in England is the original principles of pigeonhole is a place where a pigeon roost and the.
2:40
So the point of the original principle is if you have more elements to scatter around the number of boxes,
2:51
then then you have boxes, then at least one of these boxes is going to be one more than one element.
2:59
Yeah, intuitively, immediately, very, very clear.
3:05
But because mathematics is something that needs needs to be shown.
3:09
And so you can't just postulate. Not an actual.
3:14
So do here. So how do we prove this?
3:20
Well, also, I take the situation that I have a set of skills and and I assume that I have a position of a such that is.
3:26
So I know that the union of these ages from one to K contains A and I know that there is this joint and each one is not empty.
3:36
So that's one that I highlight there.
3:48
So what I'm going to assume now is that if I assume that each them is only one element, then I go to a contradiction.
3:51
And then so I then I reject the fact that I'm sorry to hear.
3:59
Gertner. Yeah, so the assumption that I have that I want to contradict is that each a each subset has only one element.
4:12
So then I come out of that saying that's not true. And then I notice more than more than one, because I also know that each of is not empty.
4:21
OK, so I know that a by the definition of the petition is exactly the union of all these A's and buy a property we've seen before.
4:30
So I've shown you on Tuesday. I think that is the size of a disjoined union is the sum of the size of the components.
4:43
So it is the properties that we that we use here. So they are used in the second part.
4:56
In the first part, I know, because as the union of all these, so these sets do have to have the same size as the same amount of elements in there.
5:02
So I'd be doing to I also know that the sum of all the of the union, so the size of the union is the sum of all the sizes of the components.
5:11
Yeah. So if the the sets would not be pairwise this joint,
5:22
then you wouldn't have this equality here because you might have that the said Sharon adamant you know, and then it becomes less then.
5:25
But in this particular case it's equal. So what I know now is that n which is the size of V is the size of the union is the
5:33
sum of the parts and each element is only one element and therefore that is K a year.
5:43
Am I gonna want to ask me a question. Thank you.
5:50
The so this now is a contradiction,
5:59
because I know I've assumed here that N and K are not equal in our case strictly smaller than N, so that's impossible.
6:01
We can't have that in it is and case more than enough.
6:10
And therefore we have a contradiction. So I have to reject my assumption, which is that he has only his eyes, only one element.
6:14
So therefore there is an age that has at least two elements.
6:23
OK, that is a what is called the constructive proof, so I use contradiction, but I don't use prove by contradiction.
6:28
You know, I used not introduction here, so I show not a statement.
6:38
Now, because the statement that I have here is the negation of the statement that I have here question.
6:45
No, I'm sorry, Mr.
6:54
Go ahead, go ahead. The lady first.
6:58
Oh, so when it says with the apair pairwise disjoined, what exactly is it, pairwise disjoined with like, why is it relevant?
7:02
No, no. So what I need I need I need this to be a petition.
7:15
Yeah. So it is the in the petition, it says here that each pair of subsets here have no intersection.
7:18
So the petition and it's like cutting as into parts of the knife, you know, you really separate the sets.
7:27
No, not in cutting us apart. There is no overlap in between the pieces.
7:35
Yeah, I don't need that here because I need this equality there.
7:41
Now, if I if it's not cut it up into pieces, then this is smaller than or equal, but because it's gotten to pieces, I know this is equal.
7:47
OK, not a gentleman. No need to know that.
7:57
Sorry. No.
8:04
OK. So I know that the sort of statement is impossible and therefore there's at least one.
8:10
So this is an important property in number theory and so many of these little small things that need quite a bit of work.
8:19
So the things that I do definitely not automatically need proof.
8:29
Very, very few things that you can state without proving. OK.
8:34
Next step is that we we are still in the context of sense,
8:39
but now we are looking at relations between science and a relation is defined as a sort of
8:44
relation exists between two sets A B and a relation is defined as a subset of the binary product.
8:52
So we have collections of bands in our OK, if R is a subset of a square we call a binary relation on ALEG.
8:59
So then is a specific kind of relation. So what kind of relationship can we have, for example, between human beings?
9:10
And we can write these down in different, different ways.
9:20
Sometimes we have to prefix for the relation and sometimes we have to relation in the middle.
9:24
And sometimes we say, well, this is a band that belongs to the relation.
9:28
Actually, the last one does formally the best one because an R is defined as a subset.
9:31
So you speak of pairs that belongs to a subset. So it is the the last one that's the official definition.
9:38
The other two are notations to express the same thing now.
9:44
And we know examples of these kind of relations, like, for example, between number of the smaller than the relation is an example.
9:48
But we have also seen the subset as far as a relation between sets.
9:58
Now, officially, this is not a relation as I define it here.
10:03
You. Yeah, because I cannot say that I can I can define a subset between two sets.
10:08
That's true. But I can't define the subset simply as a relation between the collection of all sets product,
10:17
the collection of all sets, because that's not to set now.
10:25
So what we do here, when we when I talk about a subset as a relation, I take a certain amount of freedom there because officially it isn't.
10:28
But it behaves like one and it satisfies all the properties that we want.
10:37
For example, we will see a number of them.
10:42
So you can show a lot of the properties that we have about relations for for the subset one, but is not officially a relation.
10:46
No. So I suggested here it's all these three notations.
10:55
OK, so if you need to work with relations, you have complete freedom in how to write the down.
11:01
There's no preferred notation here.
11:06
So as an example, you can take to the set of two elements and be so because it's a set with two elements, I know that A and B are different.
11:11
And so how many binary relations can I find on this or how many subsets are there in a square?
11:20
Well, that is 16. So the relationships immediately explodes when you're dealing with sense, you know.
11:27
So there are many more relations on sets than there are elements in the centre.
11:35
How we can going to explain this? Well, I know that in a square there are four bars.
11:40
Yeah. So we have a B, so they are listed here on the on the left.
11:48
These are all the pairs that are in a square and or if you like, listed here.
11:55
Yeah. That's up to them. So how many.
12:02
So in relation to the subset of, of a product, Cartesian product is four elements.
12:06
Therefore there are 60 possibilities for a relation.
12:12
As we've seen before, the size of the Powerset is and to the power to know to to power and where and is the size of the centre.
12:17
We can draw very nice diagrams, you said, if that's convenient. This is only truly applicable in the final case.
12:31
So you can, for example, say, well, if a one and be one in a pair and a to be one pair in a to be two in a bear,
12:39
they're going to represent that particular relation rather than listing it as a list of pairs,
12:46
as a set of pairs, I can talk to a diagram A and B and draw arrows from the elements and enter the elements.
12:50
And B, no, I can for binary relation to the same, but now I have to be careful.
12:57
So here it would have been OK to just draw a line because they would be a separate here.
13:04
I really need to draw an arrow because if I do not draw the arrow, then I don't know which direction the relation goes.
13:10
For example, in this particular instance, a two.
13:16
A one is a pair, but a one, a one or two is as long as I've additional aid.
13:20
382 is a pair but a two. A three is not. No.
13:27
And so here I have that, a three or three. Is it fair. And therefore there is an arrow going from a three to itself.
13:31
OK, you can relations can be defined on infinite sets in particular cases.
13:39
For example, you can define this particular relation in real numbers and then the set can be represented by by a plain where you do some some,
13:46
some, some drawing two to indicate what was said.
14:00
And we can also represent finite, finite relations by by the Matrix.
14:05
Now we have the same relation as before. So how can we prevent the Matrix?
14:11
Well, we we basically list the elements of a vertically and the elements of B horizontally,
14:17
and we mark the position in the Matrix, the true if the pair A B is in the is in the relation and it falls if it isn't.
14:24
And so you can do this with CEOs on one of DNF. So true and false.
14:34
So could I quickly put shortcut on our relations here was destroyed.
14:38
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
14:46
I mean let me go to the example here. So there's a lot happening here.
14:50
For example, this this one there. Yeah. Is a subset of this one there.
14:55
I see, yeah, it's just a relation, is a subset, is not a relation, is another subset.
15:03
They might overlap. Nobody cares. Now. OK.
15:09
Good, so we can expand this notion of the relation, of course, to to arbitrate many sets,
15:17
always find out, of course, because we don't really deal with relations on infinite constructions.
15:24
So, er. Any relation between a-one, two sets a want to and this a subset of the energy product?
15:31
It's a very natural extension of the concept that's discussed before now.
15:42
And for example, a a two Aare relations over and is two that becomes a binary relation and the.
15:47
OK, that is to say, something is happening outside of Wythenshawe you can go back to.
16:02
That means they have lost a window on my screen. Whitcombe Good, so the.
16:18
We have the. Sorry.
16:41
Yeah, we also can can go to two one, yeah, so again, no relation is just a revelation is is actually a predicate,
16:48
you know, it's a subset, you know, so we for example, you have to eat the set of all the prime numbers.
16:58
That is a regulation on the on it. So it's the concept.
17:06
Unary is not used a lot inside the inside, of course, but it is a word that you might encounter a lot later and not, of course.
17:10
So now you know what it means.
17:19
It's just a generalisation of something which naturally belongs to two enlarger to the case that it is zero outside one.
17:21
OK. And you can, for example, right there, said the finish like this.
17:30
So you have all the triples in three. Yeah. So our threes is said.
17:35
We've seen that we can duplicate these products so we can do selection there.
17:39
And what is the predicate that is satisfying? Well, the sum of the squares and then the square root of it is equal to one.
17:43
And this is of course a description of the atmosphere around the origin.
17:52
As four sets, we can take a union and intersection of relations.
18:02
And I will also introduce a new one, which I haven't done four sets before, which is to complement.
18:08
But the difference is that we this is not just arbitrary union intersection.
18:15
No, they have to have the same type so we can only so I only express union intersection
18:20
of relations that belong that are subsets of the same Cartesian product.
18:26
Yeah. So how do you do it? Well, the definition is exactly the same.
18:32
So relation union is defined as set union. So you take all the.
18:35
But now of course I can select from a set because it's so this is different.
18:40
So I noticed that exists. So instead of all the bars such that the dependent is an R or the pair is across an S.
18:45
So this co-sponsor said union. But for the fact that now both of them are in in the product space region intersection works the same way.
18:54
Yeah. So you have a in the relation to the section if it is in both the components.
19:05
And I can define the compliment of a relation as all the bars, indicators and product that are not in the relation now.
19:12
So at this point, it's interesting, too, because there was a question about said complements a little while back.
19:21
I have not defined said complement as I can to the relation component,
19:27
because you can only talk about the complement of a set in respect to another set.
19:32
So I can talk about the complement of a subset of a inside A,
19:37
but I cannot talk about the complement of A because that would be everything outside the set and we know that that's not the set.
19:42
So that would be would be ill-Defined. Yeah.
19:49
So the complement is only defined on relations because there are working within the context that you're working on the completion product,
19:53
which is a set. OK, good little exercise,
20:01
five minutes should do it if they are in this particular definition set and define or find our union as our intersection and the complement of are.
20:09
OK, we'll be back in five minutes. OK.
20:23
So they are I'm not going to write down the answer.
24:23
I'm just going to talk you through it very quickly. So the union contains.
24:27
Ah yeah. So that's a starting point. And then we add the elements in essence that are not already.
24:33
And ah so this one I don't it I add two one, three, four is already there so I add two, one and four three.
24:40
That's the union. The intersection is one, two and three, four.
24:48
And the component of that is sort of 16 elements in and this set squared, so it is the component of is a set containing 11 elements.
24:56
Yeah. So it's all the sets in the in the indicative product of the set with itself, but for the five elements down.
25:13
Good. So I can define more complex things.
25:28
For example, I can talk about what the identity relation and the identity relation is very, very strict and limited.
25:39
It only links each element with itself.
25:49
So it's it's a relation only defined as a binary relation.
25:53
So the sets on the left and the bearing and the right, then it should be the same.
25:58
Yeah. So the identity relation says that you pick those elements in a square that are identical.
26:02
Yeah. So remember, so I could have subscribed to this with a to indicate that the quality on a you know,
26:11
so it is the, the quality etc. and it's had the same insides has had a.
26:18
I can also define something as guilty in first relation, and that is a subset of a condition product that is related to the one that that a
26:25
subset of both for the fact that we flip A and B. And so we we look at the parent,
26:35
all the pairs in this that are flipped. Yeah.
26:44
So I take our own views as defiant as that of all the elements,
26:48
all the bears that are in these products would be any sort of that a subset of a subset of a timestream which are the best.
26:53
I admit while those are the ones that are in the original bear but reversed and so are a apison.
27:03
I'm sorry, I'm a bit confused about your definition of the identity relation.
27:11
OK, sorry. What's the exact relationship between S and A.
27:18
Yeah, that's that's a mistake, that's what it is they should be in.
27:26
OK, that makes sense. Yeah, no, that's a typo. OK, thank you for that.
27:30
Um, can you pass me can you just quickly re-explain investor relations?
27:36
I didn't really get it. So you take a relation that is a subset of the product and B, yeah.
27:40
So what you do is you, you, you take the collection of all those parts and you flip them all around.
27:49
So what was the second element in the bear becomes the first element of the new bear.
27:55
And I was the first element in the bear becomes the second element in a new pair.
27:59
OK, thank you. OK, so you would an example be the inverse of less than is greater than.
28:05
No, it would be great to equal. Yeah, great.
28:17
OK, yes. Oh, wait, I have a question.
28:21
Yeah. Do we need to know that? Yes, of course.
28:26
Like I said, everything that's in the notes, everything is in the slide.
28:32
Everything that I say during the lectures and everything, I think when I'm teaching examinable.
28:35
OK, thank you. And ask a question.
28:42
Yeah, go ahead. So you said like the inverse of Palestinians, greater or equal, but then I wouldn't r b like it wouldn't really work.
28:46
I don't understand. So like, let's say five, it's not less than five.
28:59
So, like, the inverse of it, you didn't have a five five in it. Yes.
29:07
So that means the years of less than is great today.
29:12
No, not really great, because five five is not a power in smaller then it is therefore a band, a complement of small then because.
29:15
All right. Right. OK, thank you. So you take all the parts that are not in that.
29:27
So when you write a RB, what does that what does that mean?
29:35
It means. This.
29:40
Bottom line. Oh, OK, thank you.
29:52
I know sometimes I have to I'm still confused about why, why so yourself last, it's quite ironical,
29:58
but it's not just greater, because when we look at the definition, I'm you don't know.
30:09
You're a great girl. That's OK. Now, I need to make that clear because I think I'm confused myself in between complement and inverse.
30:15
The inverse. No, no, it's ok. OK, cancel what I've said before.
30:24
The inverse of smaller then is greater than the compliment of inverse is greater equal than.
30:28
Oh, yes, that would make sense. OK, thank you. So I made a mistake.
30:37
Could you repeat again the compliment of smaller than is greater equal, the inverse of smaller than is greater than.
30:43
OK, yeah. OK, so the reason for this is is a important relation in sense, if you do it more than once,
30:55
you become you go back to the original and if you do try to go back to the original and noticed that there is a difference,
31:06
that is the thing that I got confused in there.
31:13
Now, between the inverse and the compliment, we just had a very nice example where they are not the same.
31:15
So can you give us a quick example of the Englewood's?
31:22
The inverse of smaller than is greater than. All right, so like we're just changing the the like the relationship with already changing the.
31:28
No, no, no, we're not changing the relationship. We were changing the order in which the elements in a occur in the power.
31:39
Oh, I see. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then we get a new relation.
31:47
And so there's more than relation that is a subset of of and square.
31:52
Now the greater than religion is also a subset of N square.
31:57
And we have that as a as a subset. The inverse of smaller then is greater than.
32:02
Yeah, I can knock it so we can compose relations,
32:10
but of course they have to fit in the sense that I can only compose ah and as if they talk about the same set.
32:19
So if there is a relation as a subset of the product A, B,
32:27
and as is a product iteration as the product of B and C. So I need that the B's much, otherwise I can't compose them.
32:32
Yeah. Then a composer. So the composition of are with S so I use this particular circle notation that I expressed is this are composed to s ok.
32:39
This is defined as the set of all the pairs in the region and ANC.
32:51
So it is the first and the last set there. And I add an element to the set if I can find to be in B such that A B is in R and B, C is in S no.
32:57
So this is like, if you like, stepping from A to see through B using R n.
33:14
S. It was an example of how this work sorry, so can you give us an example of how this work, of how this works off the top of my head?
33:20
OK, give me a second to think. It's so much easier to function.
33:38
We're not there yet, so you could take, for example, the.
33:46
Yeah, so you can take and. So let's take A, B and C, all natural numbers.
33:53
Yeah, I define R as being double.
34:02
I define S as being triple.
34:09
So it's so end and to end in an end and three, and as now, so in the composition of Arnez goes to six times so and six in the composition of Fynes.
34:14
OK, good. So as I specified before, the release is only defined if they if they click, if the intermediate set is down, so if the types correspond.
34:33
Yeah. And as an abbreviation, I can write this notation there.
34:48
So, ah, so it is officially nonsense because there is no such thing as this notation, but I use it as an abbreviation for the statement there.
34:56
Yeah, sometimes it's convenient when you do an exercise to have a little bit of you drop off your symbols in there.
35:06
OK, so examples of the composition is that if I now compose so in this particular case,
35:15
those one set yesterday, the composition of Arnez works in both directions.
35:23
Yeah. And so are composed with S.
35:28
So for example I can go from one to two and I can go from two to one and our four one one is in this set and I can go from two to three,
35:33
from three to four and therefore two fours intercept and I go from three to four and four to three, four, three, two.
35:42
I can also go from three to four to four to four and therefore three fours intercept.
35:50
And the last one is a call for the one I want to.
35:55
So for twos in this set.
35:59
So is this work similar as the natural drawing in relational algebra, is this one similar to what I need for drawing traditional algebra?
36:06
I have no idea. I don't talk about that at all. This is just citizen relations and any knowledge you have.
36:20
I might be true what you're saying. I do not know. OK, it's also outside of the outside what we're doing here.
36:27
OK, so the if I go to the composition of is with us, so as composed with our then I follow the path in different directions.
36:37
Take an example from three to four and from four to one and therefore three lines in the sand now, etc.
36:48
So the complement of not the inverse of are is the you flip all the bands around so you get four elements again, but everything is reversed.
36:56
Good. So we can all not talk also about equality between relations and the this just defined through two sets now.
37:10
So the one we are establishing that relations are the same.
37:24
We are actually dealing with the fact that this is set equality. So this is important.
37:30
Not OK, but I can show is that the so I what I'm going to show this particular property that the racial composition is associative.
37:35
I need to treat in a sense, you know, so that I can't. And there's no other way to do this.
37:47
So I have to prove two things. So I take an arbitrary element here.
37:52
So I need to show that for all pairs a person is in.
37:58
This set is also an the other said. So take an arbitrary pair then.
38:04
I know by definition of the relation composition that I can find is Z such that X,
38:08
Y and Z are in the relationship and are composed with X and set and you are in relation to now so and again.
38:16
So I go to the definition and I refer the definition and apply to, to the, to the notation and I spend it.
38:24
So I write down in words what the definition stands for.
38:32
And I have the same thing that I have another relation competition, and so do it again now and then, I also know it exists.
38:36
Why such that is in relation with why and why of religion and religion.
38:44
I would buy a wise observation, as been said.
38:50
OK, so now I have three pairs that you in T, X, Y in R and why is that in S?
38:55
I need to go to this expression here. So the first thing that I built is this one.
39:05
They're going to build an element in this set and the answer is yes, because I can take the element that I have in R, X, X, Y, and I have the element.
39:10
I'm going in the wrong direction on apologies. I work from right to left, so I need to I need to construct a better sits in this set now.
39:33
So I take it better to have an S. I have to better that in T, so I take the Banty and a picture in S and I collapsed them.
39:41
So I refer to the definition. So then I know that I exist.
39:50
Why sort of y contains the remains and the one that I assume to Z disappears.
39:55
Yeah. So I no longer have to assume the Z because that particular assumption has been compacted into the notation for the racial composition.
40:05
So I now know that the Wii you was an element of s compulsivity.
40:16
So market at affaires the matching element there. So I can apply the definition again and therefore I get that Aksu is an element of this set here.
40:22
So this one on the left. So I've shown this arbitrary elements.
40:34
So therefore the set on the right is a subset on the set womanist.
40:38
So what we use there exists is the start off for our here.
40:44
When, when we say there exist. I do what. Why, why do we use there exists instead of for our.
40:51
Because the definition of the composition uses there exists.
41:01
Oh, OK, yeah, so you can find a bear in the in and out of it and see if you can find an intermediate element in B not for every element in B, no.
41:09
If you can find an intermediate. So there exists an intermediate element.
41:23
Yeah. So this is why. So I mean, I have to stress this.
41:29
So when you do your exercises, go back to the definition and carefully apply what is what is written there.
41:33
Don't just work from what you've understood because that's very often misleading.
41:41
You very often are going in the wrong direction. Yeah, because now you've understood that it is for all and it's not.
41:46
So when you do exercise, this is how you train yourself in being able not just to reply questions that exam,
41:52
but also to to to understand the notes and to and to put the content of the notes into memory.
42:01
When you do an exercise, go to the thing that is defined and look it up, read it, apply it.
42:07
Yeah. So it's very, very important that you do this systematically because otherwise you could make a quick they are quite good.
42:13
Um, any time we get any time we have to prove something that has an equal sign between two parts.
42:23
Do we have to prove that? Let's say we have to prove it was to be do we have to be what I am B just like two sets.
42:31
Two sets. Yes. So equality is of the the the equality between sets is defined through subsets to set an example of what I just said.
42:42
So. So you look up how is equality was written and said defined they say aha.
42:54
To subsets. So that's what you have to show to subsets. OK, all right.
42:59
OK. And in some cases when you have a finite set which is written down and you have to show that is equal to another set that is written down,
43:03
you know, just very little to prove. But in general, in the things that we are doing here, we don't know the conditions that we're dealing with.
43:12
We just proving properties over sets. And therefore, you have to show the subject's relation in two directions.
43:19
There's no other way.
43:24
So very often students forget this at exams, they start writing equals everywhere and it's, you know, it's not what you need to show.
43:26
And also, you need to do to prove in two directions, otherwise it becomes only half to prove.
43:34
Yeah. OK, so so so if so, just to come back to what you're saying there,
43:41
so you have to do the proof in two directions, but occasionally you can say this, you know,
43:50
the reverse can be proved in a similar way because you look at this and say, well,
43:56
I'm just applying to composition and I'm reapplying to composition and I can do that in two directions.
44:01
Just that is slightly different in order. Not so in a case like this.
44:07
I forgive you for not doing the proof in the other direction because it is very much the same as the one that you've just done.
44:13
But you have to be sure that that's the case. So don't blowoff don't think I you know, I can't be bold and just writing this sentence down now.
44:20
And I hope that I'm right because if you're not right, then the you lose marks.
44:30
If you're right, you don't lose marks. You can write this if you're right.
44:36
But you have to be. Yeah. There's not something you can just write down song.
44:40
You have to think about it before you write it down. Sorry, I have a question.
44:44
Yeah. I'm a bit confused about the like the I can't think of the word when you say X or Y.
44:49
Well unlike Y as Z. What, what does that mean. Again, this is the same question as we had before.
45:01
It means this thing here, the bottom line. OK, thank you, good.
45:17
Yeah, we were there, we did, it's just good, so now there are a few exercises, I don't expect you to try them all the they are in the notes, I think.
45:32
I mean, the first and the will appear to I will when we come back to the first.
45:47
So it's a good thing if you try that one, because that's a tricky one. Yeah.
45:53
So even for students who have seen the solution, they find it very, very tough to write down Deon's because it's it's it's a tricky one.
45:57
But I want you to give it a try so that you understand where you go wrong when you see me to the solution.
46:05
OK, the answer I so try the first one and I suggest you can try the fourth one, for example, and the fifth one.
46:10
OK, so that is the until we break.
46:20
So I come back at five o'clock and I'll do the solutions.
46:23
I ask a question before you go. Yeah. Go see the arrow.
46:29
The first arrow you have is that is implied. Right. That's in place.
46:34
Yes. So here.
46:38
Yeah, so I have a statement that is true or false on the left, and the statement is true or false on the right.
46:44
So this is the logical implication here. I am talking about, since these are set, the qualities.
46:48
Good. OK, so let's look at these three examples, these three problems.
46:59
So, as I mentioned before, the first one is a is a relation between sets.
57:51
So I would just give the numbers so we know what they're doing here now.
57:57
So for one, I need to show I do this one is supposedly to show that the inverse of the
58:03
complement is a subset of the complement of the inverse and the other way around.
58:11
OK, well, so I do this one first problem A, problem B, so problem A,
58:26
so I write this down just to make sure that the what what I what I for my for myself and for you,
58:34
of course, in this case that we know what the goal is. So I need to show.
58:39
For. Every X in.
58:45
The first compliment we have ex is in the.
58:53
There's too much there's one there. OK, so this is what they need to show, so I take an arbitrary element in this particular thing.
59:07
So what is an arbitrary element look like?
59:15
Well, it's a bear. Yeah. So I can take it. We are dealing with a square, so take a one a two in this particular relation.
59:19
Yeah. So it is the. In terms of the compliment, well, because it's in the inverse of this relation,
59:33
by definition of inverse, we get dead a to a one is an element of the compliment.
59:45
No, no.
59:58
By definition of compliment. I get that a two a one is not in ah.
1:00:03
Yeah, it's good. So I've brought it down to the level of ah OK.
1:00:18
So I know that the bear a two, a one, which is the flipped version of the one that I started with,
1:00:26
does not occur in R so I now need to show that this particular pair, XT, which is A1, A2 belongs to the set.
1:00:32
OK, so the. I know that this is not in our I need to show that a one a two is an element of this set there.
1:00:42
So first of all, I can flip this around by definition of inverse, and I get that A1.
1:00:57
A2 is not an element of influence going in the right direction.
1:01:12
Yes. Yeah. So, yeah, I would.
1:01:18
I've used it. So if a bear is not in R then the flip transfusionist that is not in our universe.
1:01:23
Yeah. It's by definition of the inverse and then by definition of compliment we get that.
1:01:34
Therefore A1, A2 is an element of our inverse complement.
1:01:47
So this all follows directly by definition. There's no logical reasoning involved here at all.
1:02:05
So this is I've never used by using and using or by, etc. So this holds for an arbitrary element.
1:02:11
So therefore. I have that is a subset of.
1:02:21
In the other direction. No.
1:02:39
Similar to a because there is no logical reasoning involved here, just applying and reapplying definitions, you can almost walk this path backwards.
1:02:48
You yeah, you can you can flip that then around and you go from you start by this statement and you go to that statement you got.
1:02:58
So this this reasoning is almost bidirectional.
1:03:06
But for the fact that I use the word to this departure point and I was like then.
1:03:10
Yeah, but the construction of the reasoning is almost entirely bidirectional.
1:03:17
So the proof for B is very similar to the proof.
1:03:22
It just it reversed. So what I can say is here, not we first.
1:03:27
Now, again, this would be acceptable. I hope you agree with me that I could write down the whole answer, but you would not be unlighted very much,
1:03:38
because the only thing that that would show you that indeed is the same thing going back.
1:03:48
So, yeah, you are of explaining the part where it says by definition of being was a one who two does not is not included in art art inverse.
1:03:53
OK, so if a two a one is not an R and a one a two would be in our universe then a two, a one would be in r o.
1:04:08
Why is that. So, so, so imagine that I have not the not argument that I would have been in there.
1:04:23
Yeah. So without, without the reason. Just look at those two facts.
1:04:33
Yeah. So have those two pairs and. I'd be destroyed as proof orbit.
1:04:38
So imagine that you have this. Yeah, so you have a two, a one is not an R and a one or two is an element of inverse.
1:04:49
Oh sorry I misread the proof. Yeah, I thought you said they wanted to not include.
1:05:00
Oh no, no, no, no. You flip it around. OK, good.
1:05:06
Let me reconstruct this. OK, good.
1:05:10
Yeah. So the two is similar.
1:05:14
Yeah. So but I'm not writing down the full answer but I'm giving you the idea so you take.
1:05:20
A bit of work with Abbi's is easy to follow.
1:05:29
Yeah, so Abby's an element of our compost as in first then be a is an element of our compost as so there exist.
1:05:33
See? So it's that so there's the intermediate C, so B, C is an element in R and see A is an S then.
1:05:54
By definition of inversed, c.B is an element of our universe and a sea is in essential for us.
1:06:19
So a B is an element of science was composed.
1:06:31
It was not as to suggest the long way around. OK.
1:06:40
Now, again, I do nothing special, I just apply the definitions now and I will towards my goal again,
1:06:56
the proof in the other direction is taking these statements and reversing the words then no.
1:07:04
And so so it becomes it reasons in the opposite direction.
1:07:13
Yeah, so the interesting one is the last one here, and that's because the a lot of students start with this in the wrong the wrong way.
1:07:18
No. Good.
1:07:31
So what does the statement say? It says that assuming that as a subset of this show, that our universe is a subset of the universe.
1:07:38
OK, so what would be wrong is to say, OK, let our subset of us and then you start reasoning with this information because you're not getting anywhere.
1:07:48
This this is this is the wrong path. But you need to show us this now.
1:08:02
So this is this follows from OK. Show if ours a of us, then foods is a subset of Asian foods and apply show in place.
1:08:06
So if I if I approve this statement here, which is now stated in it, then not not the employees.
1:08:34
So I hope now it's clearer that this particular statement tells you that this
1:08:40
is an assumption and this is the thing that I have to prove now improving.
1:08:49
I was subsidising foods using this assumption. OK, so you start with that issue that is a subset of s OK to show.
1:08:54
And for this is a subset of, OK, how do you show days?
1:09:10
OK, so take an element in my first show that I don't know when my writing is becoming really a mess at the moment, that X is an element of this.
1:09:13
OK, so. Taken elements, so take a bear now, so take.
1:09:35
Abby. In Ivor's. OK, so what can you do with this?
1:09:44
Well, there's nothing in it, there's nothing much you need to show that this bear is innocent first.
1:09:52
And the only thing that you have is that this this subset relation holds.
1:09:57
OK, so we need to bring this statement towards a statement about, ah, OK.
1:10:01
So then by the definition of infers, I now know that B is an element of ah ok.
1:10:07
So now the assumption holds every element in ourselves, an element of this by the assumption.
1:10:19
I get that B.A. is an element of fairness.
1:10:31
Yeah, so by inverse, I know that a B is an element of those numbers.
1:10:35
Yeah, this is true for arbitrary choice of power.
1:10:43
Yeah. So I have that.
1:10:51
I was substantive this. OK, so this here is the proof.
1:10:55
For the if then statement, I know you can apply the show, it applies to go to the statement against the IT.
1:11:03
So while we can start with taking aliment from R y, because that's an assumption.
1:11:15
It's not the starting point of the profits, so the thing that's before the arrow this year,
1:11:26
this is the information that you did you can use while you are proving this.
1:11:32
So you do not start by decomposing information because you're not proving the statement, your your NRA statement you can use.
1:11:38
So if you start with an element in R,
1:11:49
then you're not you're not you should the statement that you're showing is that the universe is a subset of as a food.
1:11:51
So every element in our universe is an element of Hasenfus. That's what you have to show.
1:11:58
So you have to start with take an element in office that is a structure to prove.
1:12:02
If you start here, you're you're starting to prove the assumption this is not what you need to do.
1:12:09
Oh, OK. The assumption is information that you can use to prove the statement.
1:12:16
So here these bad assumptions. So here I use the assumption, the assumption says that as a subset of s or despairs in art and despairs that a.
1:12:21
It's very useful assumption. So can I just ask is is it still necessary for us to take X?
1:12:32
Can we just take like the AP and just carry on with the truth of the.
1:12:41
So what I'm trying to teach you here is the formal structure of the proof so
1:12:48
that you see what you should actually be writing down all the small steps.
1:12:53
And then so I'm already skipping some of the steps. You already know.
1:12:58
Talk about the for every step that I know that I need to show.
1:13:02
Yeah. So I'm already abbreviating and you can appreciate this further by saying.
1:13:07
Yeah. So for example, this sentence here, you can be removed because there's not part of the proof.
1:13:13
Right. OK, yeah. And you can also remove this, you know, it's also it's it's a note to self but it's not part of the proof.
1:13:21
Right. OK, yeah. So if you, if you bring the proof down to the essential steps, it's very small.
1:13:29
There's three or four to four statements.
1:13:36
So I'm trying to illustrate what, what, what, what I'm trying to do, how I get there, what are the steps that are making.
1:13:40
Yeah. While also trying to Yeah.
1:13:47
Let's say abbreviate a little bit the notation. Yeah.
1:13:51
So not, not everything that you write or that I've written down here, you have to write down.
1:13:56
But I strongly suggest that you write down for yourself.
1:14:00
What are the things that you're trying to prove, because then you have, you have a grip, you know, you have something to hold on to.
1:14:04
Because the bits that you're writing down are part of the proof,
1:14:12
can you you can't be penalised for writing things like, oh, no, no, no, no, but you're OK.
1:14:14
Yes, you're right. As long as what you write on is correct, it's OK.
1:14:23
But if you do not write these statements down your risk,
1:14:27
writing down something which is incorrect because you don't do not really have formulated clearly for yourself what it is that you need to do.
1:14:31
So I'm giving this as a as a as a tool to make sure that you write better proofs.
1:14:39
Thanks. You've seen the reasoning part, for example, in the second term, the lectures, dad, always right on what they need to show it gives.
1:14:45
It helps you concentrate on what is it that I'm doing?
1:14:55
Yeah. So, for example, I have not written down here by bye, by compliment, by info's, et cetera, et cetera.
1:14:59
But it's it's better if you write these steps down because then when you come back later to your solution,
1:15:06
when you're rehearsing for your exam, see your solution, you know what you were thinking.
1:15:13
So it's always better to to to write down your thought, so I am at a time not looking for the correct answer.
1:15:20
I'm looking for an exhibition of knowledge, so I want you to show me that you understand what you're doing.
1:15:29
And so this is no longer in school, that the only thing that counts is the correct answer, not the correct answer is the work.
1:15:38
Yeah. Going towards the final conclusion.
1:15:45
That's that's the answer. The answer is not. Here's your proof.
1:15:49
The answer is this is how I do the proof. So it's very important, so don't look for for for ways to minimise what you have to write down,
1:15:53
because it's better if you go into the discipline of always writing these things down, because then you make fewer mistakes.
1:16:04
And I can tell you, students make a lot of mistakes. OK, I'm going to move back to the slides now if teams wants to cooperate with me.
1:16:11
And this should be the one, yeah, good.
1:16:35
So did the other two exercises in this list are very similar in you know, you have to prove subsets in relation to directions.
1:16:40
And the path going back is very similar to the one that you show.
1:16:48
OK, you can, for example, Sasho very easily that if is a subset of the FISA relation on the on a B,
1:16:54
then the you can composite on the latitude entity on A and on the right with you don't and you get the same relation back.
1:17:06
That's also very nice. Little exercise. Good.
1:17:14
So things that don't holds. Yeah. So for example the R and R inverse are not the same relation.
1:17:19
There are of course cases where they are, but it's not true for all relations.
1:17:28
Bundarra relations are, you know, as the composition of an island is is not the same as the composition of an island.
1:17:32
And the composition is not a commutative operation. And also very importantly, the composition of R and R first.
1:17:42
That's not the identity. So in general, I repeat in general.
1:17:50
So how do you show this? Well, if you have to show a negative result, you do that normally by showing one case in which it doesn't hold.
1:17:55
So you produce what is called a counterexample. So in this particular case, we do take for our well take are to be the the just the baby.
1:18:04
Yeah, this is a subset of AP squares. I know a b a different emphasis would be B and because a B,
1:18:16
a different test of the same is a B for the second one I take to a four hour and a B for S,
1:18:22
then the composition of R with S produces a B and a composition as with our producers, the empty set.
1:18:34
No, you can do the third one, but you need to do is to find pairs that do not.
1:18:48
Yeah, so you need you need for example,
1:19:03
you need to construct are such that you have an element on the left which is linked to two elements on the right.
1:19:07
And that's normally the thing that does. OK.
1:19:13
So. Relations are subsets of the better, relations are subsets of the coalition product,
1:19:22
sort of mercifully many, and we are interested mainly in relations of very specific properties.
1:19:32
So one particular property is the external relations reflexive and what does that mean?
1:19:39
That means that every element in A is in the relation with itself.
1:19:44
So there is an element of the relation is symmetric.
1:19:50
If every I can flip every pair around and get a valid pair back.
1:19:56
So every X Y that is an R. Yeah, Y, X is also in.
1:20:01
I thought this is expressed as an if then released and answer.
1:20:06
This means that the you are assuming that the one on the left is true and then you want the one on the right to be trustmark.
1:20:10
Now you can express this but if and only if it's not wrong.
1:20:21
But if this is a stronger definition in the sense that you demand more, this is this this proof here.
1:20:25
So if you are proving that something is reflexive,
1:20:33
it only has to f then proof if you're right and if and only if you had to do to prove she has to prove them one after the other.
1:20:36
So yeah. So this is a weaker statement and therefore it's a stronger property.
1:20:43
We can call a relation transitive, and this is a perhaps a tricky definition.
1:20:51
It basically says that if I can find elements in a such that they are involved in pairs which share a common element,
1:20:58
so X, Y is an R and a bear Y, Z is in you.
1:21:10
Yeah. Then the relations transitive, then X, Y and Z are in the relation as well.
1:21:16
Yeah. So this means this is like so if you like, if you, if you see the being in the relation as,
1:21:24
as a step, you know, so I can step from X to Y and it can step.
1:21:33
And why doesn't that advance defoliation says aha.
1:21:38
But then I can also step from X. It is just a last step.
1:21:41
But this step is that. OK, so these three properties are very important.
1:21:44
You'll see a lot of them and the yeah, so we for example, the the equality relation onsets answer.
1:21:52
So we have said that everything that comes with its own native equality of relation, that's a reflex is symmetric and transitive relation.
1:22:01
And it's very easy to show because the if you talk about an element A in the set, A,
1:22:10
then it's only equal to itself and therefore it is equal to itself by the same system and is equal to itself and is equal to itself.
1:22:17
And I think it's very straightforward. A bit more complicated is the the smaller equal relational numbers and the smaller and the set inclusion.
1:22:25
Now those are reflexive and transitive relations, although this is officially not a relation.
1:22:37
It is. It satisfies these properties. So this reflexive intransitive, you know,
1:22:43
it's not symmetric because you can't flip the departures around and get the statement always know and then you can take the smaller than relation.
1:22:49
That is a transitive relation, but it is not reflexive because no number is smaller than itself and nor is it symmetric,
1:23:00
because if you have a pattern in the relation, you flip it around, you get a bit is not in the relation.
1:23:07
OK, so reflexive, symmetric intransitive. We will see that the relations to satisfy all three.
1:23:14
Yeah. So it's the like for example, equality relations, one of them.
1:23:21
They are very important in mathematics. Good.
1:23:25
So. Let's see what we can do today.
1:23:32
There are six exercises. I want you to do the second and the third.
1:23:38
OK, again, I give you 10 minutes, I'll come back with the underestimations. So let's try and solve these problems.
1:23:50
I need to swap. My window again.
1:30:29
Yeah, yeah, so before I of I ask a quick question, if it's Greek, yes, I so it's equality relation the same as Galatia.
1:30:47
No, no. OK. For example, Sofia at the site is a good things happening there.
1:31:00
So for example, the. Yeah, so this is these are not identical strings, three plus four is equal to seven,
1:31:11
but the thing on the left of the equal standing on the right side is not the same thing.
1:31:22
OK, yeah. So equality is it depends on how it is defined.
1:31:27
Good. So in this particular case, I've appreciated a few things, so I need to show anything on the air, so that's proven to directions.
1:31:37
So I first do to prove that if Oximetry Denna is a subset of this as before, and the proof is exercise, this is what I need to show.
1:31:47
Yeah. So I take so to show.
1:31:57
So if I assume that is symmetric, you don't have to show that are is a subset of after's and answers.
1:32:04
This is a subset of art because I have to show you that. OK, so the first one so and B so A take a pair in I take a B in.
1:32:18
Yeah.
1:32:35
Then the definition of symmetry says that all the pairs that are for all pairs in, in a square, if the pairs in are then the flip version is an R.
1:32:36
Yeah. Then by definition of symmetry, we get that B.A. is in as well.
1:32:51
Yeah, then by definition of the first definition of sacred music.
1:33:06
Make sure you make us all fish. You not talking to me? Would it be like it was over there that you unit in symmetric definition if it was.
1:33:16
No, the no, no, no sort of definitive symmetric says that it could go to the slide,
1:33:31
it says that for all X and Y in a if X Y is an R, then why X is an R?
1:33:39
So did notice that here I'm not, so when I make this step, I'm not writing our infuser.
1:33:48
So the deep but amusing here is the assumption, yeah.
1:33:57
Yeah, thank you, yeah, so it just affected isometric. You know, so isometric allows me to flip to parent and stay in our yeah,
1:34:05
and now I apply the first construct which says, OK, well, if B if A is inhered and abs in our in our universe.
1:34:18
OK, so that's the density B.
1:34:26
Almost identical. To a sweeping the universe, so you start with our version of you walk backwards.
1:34:35
Yeah, so it's very much the same reasoning.
1:34:49
OK, so this is the implication from left to right, the implication for right to left that says that if is equal to our own views, then symmetric now.
1:34:52
So I need to show not to be first.
1:35:09
Right. On the assumption I assume is an.
1:35:13
So I talked to my question, just go ahead.
1:35:24
So in your last line, on the previous brief, you said then by definition of inverse a an element of our inverse, should it be?
1:35:29
No, because I am flipping the pair that I was sorry.
1:35:37
You're flipping the paper. Yeah, OK.
1:35:44
So I make the first step in the interest that flips the banner and puts in my mind as well.
1:35:48
I'm not opposed to religion. OK, so I started with A, B and R and I've got a B in our influence on this.
1:35:52
What I wanted to show, because that's the the first step in this part either.
1:36:01
OK, so here and I need to show that for.
1:36:07
Every baby in ah, we have a baby in our universe.
1:36:13
OK, so take. So this is a all statement and you show the full day.
1:36:25
But taking an example, let's make this X Y, it's better because this is valuable.
1:36:30
So take a B in R, OK, by the assumption no, this is something means two things.
1:36:37
It's upset in both directions. So by the assumption as a subset of Ifirst so a B is an element of an inverse.
1:36:50
OK, so we have taken an element and I showed it to our viewers for an arbitrary element.
1:37:02
Which is true for the Treasury, a B. So what is my conclusion?
1:37:12
So the definition holds so asymmetric. Yeah, so this proves there's only one direction because there's no no double path to walk that good.
1:37:27
Excuse me. So what was the show of the second?
1:37:51
For every pair in our we have, that bear is in our office, that's it.
1:38:05
So this is the thing I need to show is the definition of symmetry. All right, understood.
1:38:11
Thank you. Yeah, OK.
1:38:18
Apologies if I missed it, but, uh, did you show no one where our reflexive if and only if the identity of the identity of a nation is a subset of.
1:38:26
No, no, no, no, no, I asked you to do. The I haven't done that because I asked you to do this one, I think that's more a mistake.
1:38:42
I mean, I wanted to do the things a little bit more tricky.
1:38:59
So the first one is pretty straightforward. Yeah, the but I mean, the structure of the reasoning in in in the first one is very,
1:39:04
very similar to to this particular one because the so all all this proves that I do.
1:39:13
So I have the structure of to prove I know what steps are allowed to make and I always go,
1:39:20
I go to the definition and say, OK, you want me to show this particular thing, how is it defined.
1:39:26
OK, I'll show, I'll try to prove how it is defined now because that's a statement of mathematics.
1:39:30
Yeah. So show that it prove that a relation symmetric.
1:39:36
You can't do it if you don't know what symmetric means.
1:39:42
So you have to go look up the definition and say, OK, this now is a predicate and I know how to prove a predicate.
1:39:46
So why do you say that the definition is for our expert in our we have every power in our universe?
1:39:55
I think that should be for our Abebe Herrion. Are we have people like yours?
1:40:03
Absolutely true. That's what it was. Let me let me recap this. I, I slipped up.
1:40:10
OK. We have so what we have here is it's by X, you see how close the statements are.
1:40:18
So why X is an R, so we need to show that.
1:40:34
So we take a B and AB assumption is a subset of us.
1:40:40
So a B is in our process. OK, yeah.
1:40:45
And then we need to use the definition of msica. OK.
1:40:50
No you're right. You're right. You're very, very good for you to point out that I made a mistake so I need to show this.
1:40:59
So for every X Y we have to do Y axis and also take an AP, an R by assumption on and on first.
1:41:05
So Abby's not on first and then by definition of inverse now we get that B A is in on.
1:41:14
OK, so I have taken a B and I've shown that B is and are therefore symmetrical.
1:41:28
Good. Thank you for that. I let me go back to the last lines of today, so I need to.
1:41:39
Good. So I strongly recommend you try and actually I I think it will put a few of these in the party for this week, for next week.
1:42:03
So, by the way, can I ask, is the workload doable, the amount of staff that I ask you to hand in?
1:42:13
Yeah, I'd say OK. OK, yeah, was just right.
1:42:23
So we've seen the definition of a reflexive symmetry, contrastive and I can define what is called that equivalence relation.
1:42:33
And so that's the relation that combines all these three things.
1:42:44
And we will see how important they are, because a lot of crucial things are used with equivalence relations, you know, like, for example.
1:42:48
So the example I gave before the three plus four is equal to seven. So that equals is an equivalence relation and romantic expressions.
1:42:59
So you are if three plus four is equal to seven and seven is equal to one plus six,
1:43:07
then three plus four equal to one plus six, you know, so it's not equality on numbers, but it's equality and expressions.
1:43:13
And so equivalence relations are literally everywhere and very, very important.
1:43:20
Good. So if I have an equivalence relation, I often used to think the notation with a substrate, if I want to name the relation.
1:43:28
So this this notation that says that art and equivalence relation is equivalent to be that's the how you pronounce it is equivalent to be in our OK.
1:43:36
And sometimes I drop the subscript if I's on the now.
1:43:49
So what does an equivalence relation mean. Well he says well OK, we can't distinguish.
1:43:55
So it's not it's not true equality in the sense of equality, where there's equality in sense of it.
1:44:00
Is this essentially the same thing? So are they distinguishable? Can I separate these two things so we know we can't distinguish elements from itself?
1:44:08
Yeah, and if I cannot distinguish X from Y, then I also cannot distinguish right from X.
1:44:17
And if I cannot, this X and Y and Y cannot be things from said.
1:44:24
There are also actions that cannot be distinguished. So that's basically the the thing that I want to with the equivalence relation says yeah.
1:44:29
So if you like, it's a bit like a week equality's again.
1:44:41
Three plus four equals the seven. The strings are not identical, but the value that they represent is now.
1:44:45
So they're not really equal, but we see them as equal.
1:44:51
OK, I will see some more stronger examples of equivalence relations that show the things that are written down differently are essentially the same.
1:44:56
Yeah. So for example, so the identity relation on a.
1:45:08
So this is the the this is the equal relation that comes with, you know, or if you like, any normal equality relation.
1:45:12
So we have the equality of relational numbers. That's that's an equivalence relation.
1:45:21
We can define the equivalence on sets by saying, well, they are the same, they're equivalent sets if they have the same size.
1:45:27
Yeah. And for mathematics, this is the true identity of a set how many elements doesn't have.
1:45:36
And that's the real thing that counts. You can talk about people having the same age as defined as being that the ages is equal now.
1:45:44
So that's there's an equivalence relation as well. Of course, on a particular day it changes.
1:45:56
And I can define a relation of numbers that basically states that A is in relation in our and would be if the the the
1:46:02
difference between B and A is a multiple of N and divides into the difference and that is written in is pretty good notation.
1:46:14
So I can find a Q and said such that a few times and is a B minus A or I can take another definition here for example.
1:46:23
He is really. So this relation as is, is equivalence relation,
1:46:35
but it is immediately clear that you that you are equalling or equivalent pairs that are completely different.
1:46:40
So an actually actual see or not know you won't see this anymore.
1:46:50
This is a way of representing original numbers.
1:46:54
And so you can see this as fractions and you can say that the fraction on the left and the friction on the right are equal and that's it.
1:46:57
So this is the fraction set over and said to Eventa and they are equal if the cross product this is say this is how equality between fractions.
1:47:04
OK, so this is so this particular I can put inequality behind our equals.
1:47:14
Q If you like. So this is a clear example of things that represent the same value but are written down very differently.
1:47:21
So fractions are notorious for that. OK, so we can look at equivalence classes,
1:47:29
and that is a way of separating a set that has an equivalence defined on them because you actually want to do is say,
1:47:38
well, OK, if things are equivalent, are indistinguishable, then why am I looking at two different things?
1:47:46
They should all be the same. Yeah. So this is what the equivalence, the notion of equivalence class does.
1:47:53
So the equivalence class of A contains all the elements in a.
1:47:58
Yeah. That are equivalent to small A on the R.
1:48:03
So the equivalence class, this is normally written with square brackets. You can index it with the R if that's important.
1:48:08
But it's very important that you know that this contains all the elements that are
1:48:15
equivalent to a like three plus four and as a string and one plus six as a string,
1:48:19
a seven as a string. They are all inside the equivalence class of seven.
1:48:26
OK, you can then look at the ad, just the equivalence classes, yeah, and this is normally written as a division,
1:48:32
so you take a over ah section set and the the so you bring then this whole set down to the essential representative of the different classes.
1:48:42
And I give you some examples on the next slide, the.
1:48:57
Not on this flight, you know, so for example, so we go back to the chart we had before,
1:49:06
so the answer is contains the pairs of the numbers that are a multiple of and apart, then the equivalence class of one contains all the numbers.
1:49:11
So this is with five. Yeah. So US five and is five.
1:49:22
So this contains all the numbers that are multiple of five away from one.
1:49:27
So there's all these, there's an infinitely large set and you can actually see very quickly that there are only five equivalence classes.
1:49:32
Have given us four zero four one four two four three four four.
1:49:44
But there's no equations class four five, because that's the same as equivalence class four zero.
1:49:51
So by taking the equivalence relation over a set and looking at equivalence classes,
1:49:57
you are collapsing the the massive amount of different elements onto just one.
1:50:03
So this infinite set of all the multiples of five plus one is represented just by the equivalence
1:50:11
class one and with the fraction notation that we had before that the pair three five,
1:50:20
for example, that is the it's it also is represented by an infinity lance.
1:50:26
So this is what you do with fractions. So one of the two is the same as two or four.
1:50:34
You don't distinguish two. It's the same, the same element, although the syntactic representation is different.
1:50:38
OK, so it's the equivalence classes are the partition of the original side.
1:50:46
Yeah. So we we will at the next election will start by saying that equivalence class is partition is set.
1:50:54
And so, but that's the problem that needs to be proven. But yes, you're right, it is a partitioning.
1:51:01
But it doesn't come for free, you have to prove that property because it's a little tricky.
1:51:09
OK, OK, well, I will start with that on on Tuesday. OK, so we're already at the end of the lecture a little over time.
1:51:14
Are there any more questions? You want to go to dinner?
1:51:22
It's OK, I'm hungry and I will stop the lecture and I will release the coursework on Kate
1:51:31
this evening and then I will see Asiel on the on Tuesday and have a great weekend.
1:51:41
Thanks, Stephanie. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
1:51:49
Thank you. Bye bye. Hi, Stefan.
1:51:54
Yeah, quickly, I David, you're. OK.
1:52:02
OK.
1:52:06
