Title: Amazon ACI Talk Jan 2021
Category: AY20/21
Lecturer: Tom Curtin
Date: 19/01/2021
So welcome, everybody, to this applications of computing, an industry seminar.
0:01
We're very pleased to have Arvind and Hawkei from Amazon with us who are going to tell us all about something to do with prime video, right?
0:07
Yes. Take it away. Guys, thanks very much for coming to present in this series.
0:19
We appreciate it. Great to be here as well. Let me share my screen again.
0:24
Yes. Can I see the screen? Yeah, looking good.
0:37
Great. Yeah, I think go through the slides and get started.
0:41
I think I'll have my join in a few minutes and his sister will join the Q&A as well.
0:47
But I'll be driving that presentation primarily. So, yeah, start with the introductions.
0:51
Hurray! As senior staffer and mentor at Amazon, both of us work for the Living Room Platform Organisation.
0:57
So we sort of tackle the problems in the living room space for Amazon. And I myself, am I.
1:05
When I lead a team within the living room platform, Mark, in particular,
1:10
my team builds sort of the application kit is a set of capabilities and competencies that you would need to build
1:15
an application in the living room space if you want to distribute an application on third party living room.
1:21
I speak more about what we do and I a set of problems that we solve soon.
1:26
I. Do you want to get a short introduction about yourself?
1:33
Hey, I was just getting started. I think I still am mute, by the way.
1:39
All right. How about now? Excellent. Yeah.
1:55
So hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for allowing and tonight to have this presentation to you today with you today.
1:59
My name is haha. I've been in Amazon for close to six years now in a number of roles.
2:07
I've been in a global US back in Seattle, Washington.
2:14
I also was the site leader for Amazon in Madrid, Spain.
2:19
And for last year and a half I've been working here in Primedia. I manage an organisation called the Living Room Platform.
2:24
I work closely with our men and we work on the next generation frameworks that
2:31
enable everyone to build great experiences on living room devices like televisions,
2:37
streaming devices like fire TV and Apple TV, as well as gaming consoles like X books on et cetera.
2:44
So I hope you enjoy the presentation and I'll hand it back to you.
2:51
Thanks. Yeah. To give a bit a bit of history about myself, as I've been with Amazon for about four 1/2 years now,
2:56
I'm working on multiple different themes and brand video and the living room, but living Doumar.
3:05
So right now I'm with the platform and I work closely with Saray on inside the
3:10
heart problems that you saw in the Lingam space going ahead with presentation.
3:13
Yeah, this. Which should be the agenda for today.
3:19
I'm going to cover a bit about the living room landscape. What that means and and what is the what is the problem solving?
3:22
It's being everywhere. And also speak about brand video and sort of the technical challenges that we solve and how we saw
3:29
them and then speak a bit more about where we are now and what the future future holds for us.
3:36
And then let's start with the Q&A, but feel free to stop me during any part of the presentation, if you have any quick questions as well.
3:42
Happy to answer them. Let's get started.
3:49
So let's talk of the history of Amazon in the living room space.
3:55
So Amazon set foot in the living room space started around 2011 with video, actually.
4:00
So from video, as it's now called Primedia, it used to be called Amazon Instant before.
4:08
So Pramoedya of Energy launched in 2011. So the vision of Primedia was to ensure that people get the best streaming experience
4:14
across devices and across like across Web browsers and across mobile devices as well.
4:23
So in 2011, Primedia launched. And in 2014, they launched in the U.K., the MGP and also 2014 marks the launch of the five TV and ITV stick as well.
4:30
And in 2015, the launch of brand video I don't subscriptions came about where you could see not just from media,
4:43
but also have subscriptions to other channels like HBO or I'm DVD.
4:49
We are other things as well.
4:54
Then in 2016, Primedia launched for multiple countries, which is about 200 countries, which is also the year when Echo and Alexa launched.
4:56
As I was. But I was part of the brand media project that launched across 2200 countries worldwide.
5:07
It is quite a bit of challenge for Amazon in terms of both technical and technical and scaling the services,
5:13
because that is the first time where we could we should we had to also tackle the problem of,
5:21
hey, how do we tackle customers who travel across the countries as well?
5:25
So it was not just a problem for what you saw on the device and aren't on on a particular application.
5:30
It is also how would you tackle it across the marketplace and across countries as well?
5:37
And we do is the one one effort that spearheaded Amazon,
5:43
so our living room efforts and I'm going to speak a bit more about the living room landscape here.
5:48
So what I mean by the living room landscape is that essentially what I mean by living room
5:55
is these very sort of devices on which we have to distribute primarily application to.
6:01
So these devices, if you look at the third party, the room,
6:09
do ISIS have very diverse platforms and diverse operating systems and diverse technology stocks as well?
6:12
So and it's certainly not possible for far like any company to build like one theme for each of these devices.
6:19
Right. There are literally thousands of these devices.
6:27
So I think if we have to expand to every to be present in every part of the living room landscape,
6:29
it means that we have to solve the problem of building a technical architecture that scares across all of these very platforms, so to speak.
6:37
A bit more about the Lingam landscape. The problem being everywhere.
6:45
So one of the one of the hot one of the problem is that it makes the mixed up problem
6:50
of being everywhere hard is that the device in a very number of device capabilities.
6:57
Because if you look at living room space, you have these low end devices like Roku,
7:01
which which you could buy for potentially, I think eight to ten dollars.
7:07
And like radio or TV, which support Internet connexion up until, like, you know, Apple TV or PlayStation five are x box to 60.
7:11
That support, like huge amount of memory and compute value could build applications more easily that are highly performing.
7:19
So what it means for us to be everywhere is that we need to build one architecture that
7:27
shares across all of these capabilities in a way that the customers and the customers enjoy.
7:31
Eventually, the application that's being on the architecture and the other one, that's the platform diversity, as I mentioned before.
7:37
So some of these devices are in process. Some are an android and some are unlike Windows and places and has its own operating system as well.
7:45
And I think LG has something called GraBois and Samsung has its own OS and browser called Isaan.
7:52
And what it meant for us is to come up with a solution that bakhos the platform diversity.
8:01
And what happened was that essentially means is the a number of other options you have, right.
8:07
When you are building a team to solve a problem,
8:12
you need to know what are the technical skills that you need for for the team to solve the problem effectively.
8:15
So what that meant for us to solve this also figured out what are the key technologies that are available for us to solve?
8:22
If we have to solve these problems of diverse architectures and capabilities and far more importantly.
8:29
So a lot of people don't seem to do this as often.
8:38
People tend to cost less cars as well. A lot of people say this is true from our day to day work.
8:41
It's that it's evident that a lot of people still use TV that they bought in 2000 five, 2006.
8:49
And it's important for us to solve this in a way that those customers who get the application
8:54
in the living room space and they can use it for the lifetime of the device as well.
9:01
And again, this is another problem that we have to solve as part of our technical architecture.
9:07
So how are we going to distribute the application and the solutions that we build for the customer?
9:15
How are we going to continuously update the application that we build for our customers?
9:20
For example, each of these each of these devices have their own way of updating the applications.
9:25
And how are we going to leverage that? Are should we build something ourselves? So, yeah.
9:32
So looking at all of these sites before you can see how diverse the devices are and what that
9:38
means for us to solve the problem are to scale a scale solution across all of these devices.
9:45
And in essence, the way we want to solve this problem is looking backwards.
9:51
We looked at what the customers wanted, which is basically the customers don't care about what devices these that they using.
9:56
They don't care about what platform they're using. It's what they care about.
10:02
At the end of the day is that, hey, it's my it's my application performance and about who I feel I can use it in a way that's very smooth.
10:06
So and it also customers also care about whether their application takes advantage of all the device capabilities.
10:16
For example, some devices support light playback and some don't and some support a particular kind of buffering mechanism and some don't.
10:22
And this is the Arctic. Is the application able to leverage all of that to give the best performance for the customer?
10:30
And that was kind of like the core value that we had when.
10:37
We tried to solve the problem of being everywhere.
10:42
And that's one of the options I'm going to speak about is something that our teams considered a few years ago.
10:46
So one was that up say we build the used architecture by exploiting the resources that are on the devices.
10:51
So it means that we could essentially burn had similar five applications or react applications.
10:59
That turns on all of those. If you look at that.
11:03
That doesn't solve our problem entirely because there are devices that run that don't have
11:09
doors that want us to build applications that pertaining to the operating system only.
11:13
So we couldn't essentially build one in one app that distributes everywhere.
11:19
But we could solve the problem of performance because sincerely building it for the browser.
11:23
We could leverage what the browser does. And as the browsers get updated on the device itself.
11:27
The performance would keep increasing.
11:32
But still, it didn't give us a complete control over what we can deliver to the customers in terms of in terms of performance.
11:33
And and because because these are Web apps we update ability of applications were something that we could solve as part of this option.
11:41
And also developer availability.
11:49
We knew the exact set of skills required and the exact sort of technologies required for us to solve this problem at scale.
11:53
But we were still not happy entirely with this option because it doesn't allow us to build one app that scales everywhere.
12:00
And the next other option is that we better react native like.
12:07
Like this would work on platforms that are Android windows that give us because those platforms support react native.
12:12
And we could just build one of the drones and all of those platforms.
12:20
It would be more like it would explode. The technology is often bedrock native.
12:24
But again, I think we we have to repurpose some of the code that we use for the browser to ensure that it's Jack Native compliant.
12:30
Even in this option, we didn't have enough scope for distributing the application for every AFA, every single Blackcomb.
12:39
For example, Roko has its own Bradstreet technology stock that we need to support.
12:46
So this still that didn't allow us to build one on application. But this is another viable option to distribute the most to ISIS.
12:52
And the third one was going native, where we built our own browser, sort of like out of an application native application framework.
12:59
So what that meant was that, you know, we give you one uniform surface for Pramoedya,
13:07
flirting with the run, entering playback that that the application can can exploit.
13:13
For example, if we provide the needed application FIMA,
13:19
then we control what is supported by the framework and what the application can exploit as well.
13:22
And we were super careful in deciding how this framework should be as well.
13:28
So we wanted it to be like a very thin layer that is a secret to the devices by the partner.
13:32
Some of the partners are less flexible in terms of distributing or updating the native layer code on their new ISIS,
13:38
and some of them are more proactively updating their native layers softwares.
13:48
So we want to ensure that, you know, we have one thing,
13:54
native layer and the rest of the rest of the logic of the framework is downloaded on upstart so that it gives us complete control of data.
13:56
Belardi as well. In terms of what what can be changed on the render rendering layer, which is not the binary.
14:04
So the going native option seems something that this is very promising for us.
14:11
It also meant that we have to solve some of the hot problems that are on the device
14:15
level in terms of building a browser ground up or lack of native application,
14:19
famous ground up.
14:23
So this option provided us sort of like a way to build one application that runs everywhere and control the performance of the application.
14:24
So because here, if you look at the native layer, it's something to be honest about.
14:32
It's something that over time we can potentially update as well.
14:36
And it allows us to take complete control over what we can expect from the device in terms of providing the best customer experience.
14:40
And this is not as hundred percent updatable as the previous options,
14:47
because because we are having a thin native layer that gets updated with the application from 50 devices fumbler,
14:51
it is not on an updatable, but be kind of tackled. That problem using an approach to add native layers very, very thin.
15:00
And most of what is on the application framework can be updated remotely, which we control.
15:08
So this is something what we ended up with then eventually.
15:14
Where are we on top of the farmer of the device, we brought in the device abstraction layer using C++ and the native engine framework using C++,
15:18
and that that is similar to the Web browser software, so on.
15:27
And we built an abstraction SDK on the platform, which is basically something that any application would need to build their user experience.
15:32
So what is SDK? Basically, it abstracts away all the device level quirks and explains only those API that the application
15:40
needs to do to be built without having to worry about any of these two specific capabilities.
15:48
Solving this problem essentially gave the prime video up like a predictable platform on which they could they could build.
15:55
And they know that if they built it, using those APIs spread by masticate would run everywhere.
16:03
And it's for us to internally manage, you know,
16:08
how the device without abstraction sat down so that the application never has to worry about what device it does.
16:11
It will always run in the most performance way possible across every device.
16:15
And and this is currently what we ended up with. Asla ended up.
16:20
But it is something that that Pramoedya currently runs on.
16:24
John, if you see the family app on any of the third party devices now,
16:28
that is essentially the same same application that is running across all of those devices on the platform that we just discussed.
16:33
Mark? So just to reiterate kind of what we covered, so the living room landscape, as we discussed,
16:40
is quite fragmented and distribution, distributing single offices as efficiently, as hard.
16:50
And we also spoke about a bit about what are the options to be considered as a platform to solve this problem and how we solve it.
16:56
And we had a really great place in terms of, you know, how efficient we can be to distribute the application across multiple devices.
17:04
And I have to say,
17:11
so the hard problems that I worked on in the past few years as some of the most interesting problems that I've done in my career as well,
17:13
because unlike like more Metro platforms like Web or mobile, a living room sort of presents problems where we we are pioneering the solutions first.
17:19
And this is something that's something that personally excites me a lot because we are defining how living space has has
17:29
has been evolving and will evolve in the future in terms of what can be done and where the problem is that can be solved.
17:37
Given that maybe now. So the past us has technology.
17:47
Technologies evolve. This might change in the future as well as to what I've seen on TV.
17:51
It's been evolving into something called Google TV.
17:56
And Apple has its own operating system as well. And also react native is growing as well.
18:00
So we are consistently thinking about, you know, what is the right broad set of technologies for the future and what what the customers
18:04
want in terms of expediencies and what it means for other applications to come
18:12
onto the living room space and what it means to give like a consistently predictable
18:16
experience for the customers and the application developers on the Lingam space.
18:21
Yes. And and you can and you can start applying for jobs in the living room space, unprime video to arms and jobs.
18:27
There are quite a few student programme so available. And the deadline is 9th of February.
18:39
And you can look at other quite the very different jobs available as well, including software development, engineering,
18:46
machine learning solutions, architect and data science, because we built a platform that has a very different variety of problems to be solved.
18:53
That's quite a lot of scope for different kind of rules that are required for helping solve these problems.
19:01
Also, do take a look at our job portal and look at the doors that you want to apply for.
19:08
I lend my presentation here are leaving the space for Q&A. Lovely.
19:16
Thanks very much, Ivan. All right. Do we have questions for the teen then?
19:22
I've got a question, sir. Yeah, go ahead.
19:33
I was just wondering about you talking at the start about how you are implementing private video in over 200 countries.
19:40
I don't know if he's still working on that.
19:47
Well, the complications with this and there's some content isn't viewable in different countries and stuff due to IP.
19:48
How have all the complications with having to roll out in different countries? Sure.
19:55
I think one of the problems that we had was a travelling customer.
20:01
So how do you ensure that you provide the catalogue that the customer can watch across different countries?
20:04
How do you detect a customer from a particular marketplace has travelled to a different marketplace?
20:10
And what are the things that you can legally show them?
20:14
That is one problem that we had to solve on how how to solve the customer better in terms of catalogue
20:17
and experience that they have in terms of playback than another layer of complexity is that,
20:23
you know, the catalogue itself, even though you have one title based on the certification requirements per country,
20:28
the same title had to be like some of the scenes in a particular title can be shown in
20:35
every country based on the legal requirements of the country in terms of what can be shown,
20:41
which means that the catalogue team had to solve this problem for the travelling customer on are not just showing not not just what to show,
20:45
but also what kind of playback had to be created. Right.
20:55
And apart from that, some of the other unfranked recollect some of the other problems that we face around the same time.
20:59
One of the other other things is that how do you effectively cash the catalogue content across countries as well?
21:09
People have asked the demand for different catalogue content different.
21:14
You need to ensure you optimally cache the content across different media and so that
21:19
the customers get minimum of time in terms of streaming and better buffering times.
21:23
That is one of the problem that we had to solve.
21:29
And also, I think some of the more nuanced problems that we had was that there were security vulnerabilities that could be exploited on the devices.
21:32
And that depends on the device market across different countries.
21:43
For example, if we had to if we find a security flaw in a particular chipset,
21:47
how do we ensure that we communicate to the customers about the vulnerability and how we communicate?
21:52
How do we stop the service of Primedia? We have to only for that chipset.
21:57
It's a very hard problem to solve. And that's some of the problems that came up.
22:02
Yeah, I hope that answers your question. Do you have any thoughts about that?
22:07
All right. Yeah. So I think you keep most of the important points.
22:11
I mean, there is obviously the whole commercial aspect of that pride where, you know, if you look at the brain video,
22:15
you know, we have content that we come up with and we produce more content than we know.
22:23
And then that you come with the brain. Now we have channels and there was an implied content.
22:28
And then obviously it's one of those those different types of content like you need to figure out even from a commercial contractual perspective.
22:33
And then this is like bespoke, potentially bespoke, never changes.
22:43
You know, with different providers around the world. So I think a lot of the complexity on that.
22:47
And then you could the subscription service and then how do you pay mony?
22:52
So there's another world of technology in addition to to the actual how do I
22:57
get the playback to play correctly in front of a customer on the back end?
23:03
Right. Like, how do you subscribe? How do you account for the money that is being paid?
23:08
How do you distribute that money to the right provider?
23:12
All of the other proper safety and making sure that you're never going to show content that you sugar by your refusal by location.
23:16
That's very big technical problem. Thanks. Derek.
23:25
Josh, are you happy? And as a useful thing.
23:32
Lovely. Thank. Thanks, guys. Anybody else got a question? Hi there.
23:35
I have one. Can you go ahead, Alex? All right, thanks. So I have a question regarding your platform design.
23:40
So given that you chose to go with the native approach over the Web app or the others,
23:47
how do you deal with the Trade-Off between abstraction from those different
23:53
devices that you support and potential really good device specific capabilities?
23:59
Like if you have some features that only some devices support, you break the platform abstraction and let the like,
24:05
let the application use specific capabilities that only go to some devices.
24:12
Or do you make a hard cut and have full abstracts? Sure.
24:16
I think we have this question heavily debated. Multiple, right?
24:19
I mean. Yeah, take it away. Does. So, yeah, I think I think there are multiple levels at which you can solve this, right?
24:22
It's a really good question, Alex. So one of the things that what we do is that we expose the capabilities of the device for the applications.
24:31
And what happens is that, you know, the applications can then choose whether they want to leverage that capability or not.
24:41
So it's super important for us to these device capabilities. But at the same time, provide the freedom for the applications to use them as needed.
24:47
And it also also depends on like see if that capability is available.
24:54
The application may not choose to use it. And if it's available, if it's available, then the application has its own way of solving how to use it.
24:59
Right. I say that because it knows that the capability is available on a particular device,
25:07
then they can choose to enable or disable it based on a particular configuration and point that day that they control.
25:12
So that's how it's being tackled.
25:18
So on our end, we we abstract those capabilities in a way that the applications don't have to worry about when they are implemented.
25:19
At the same time, we provide those agents like leverage in terms of exploiting that capability if it's available and
25:25
let application choose that they want to or they want to use that when they want to use that.
25:32
Yeah, so. So, I mean, I think so.
25:38
This is like such a great question and I'm I'm very impressed you picked up on this because this is obviously one of them the most and phrase,
25:40
you build the platform because you want to fulfil some sort of promise of you
25:48
write your code one time and then your code is just gonna work everywhere. And how do you avoid that?
25:54
The functionality is basically the lowest level denominator across everything, because that's the only thing that you can guarantee.
26:00
So as a platform,
26:10
one of the things that we want to do is we want to make sure that any developer that is building applications on top of us like Brand BVO,
26:11
that they are empowered to actually do whatever they want for that Apple TV experience or that Android TV experience that they feel that is important.
26:18
We hope that as we work with our customers and as we learn about these capabilities,
26:28
for example, LG televisions have this thing called Pontell Control,
26:34
where you kind of like wave the remote control like a Harry Potter wand and you literally have a pointer like a computer pointer on the on the TV.
26:39
You can like dancing around. And then, you know, maybe there's, like, different ways to interact with particular search experience.
26:47
That's for Apple TV or for fire TV. Right. So what we really strive for is that as we learn about these capabilities,
26:54
that we expose our API in such a world that is powerful and that it provides leg benefit for all of our customers,
27:02
but we don't consider ourselves Blocher's. So you can literally go right.
27:10
And if statement and say if this device supports this capability, then I'm just gonna go crazy.
27:15
And then you can ride experiences or features forward your app that are very expensive for your app.
27:20
And I guess a way for me to worry is like you don't have to use us for everything so we won't get in the way of you innovating.
27:26
I hope that makes sense. Yeah, definitely.
27:33
Thanks for that answer. They kind of do both. Great.
27:37
Any other questions? I'm a bit surprised nobody has ask about internships and what are the internships in Amazon?
27:43
Is it fun? Is there any anybody who has curiosity on our internship programmes?
27:56
I'm sure the students would like to hear about that. Why don't you go ahead? Yeah, totally.
28:02
So so I've been absent for five years. I don't even know how many interns I welcome anymore.
28:06
Just like 50 or 60. And especially when I was in Spain, I was managing the side.
28:12
So I will oversee and help oversee the intake of interns, you know, across Europe.
28:17
Really, you know that one to the Madrid. I think one of the best things that we offer Samsun and that me and all my managers like
28:23
Carbon would really tried to do is we make sure that our interests are not doing menial work.
28:32
So the projects that you will get in Amazon as an intern,
28:38
they are designed in such a way to make sure that we want to give you a project that your code will actually be running in production.
28:42
Because we want we want not only do we relate the experience, oh, what is real professional life?
28:51
You know, how do I build a feature? Unusually, the journey during those three or four months of internship is pretty cool.
28:57
We give you the opportunity to write a document that expresses the business problem.
29:03
And then after that, we let you design the technical solution and then eventually obviously write the code.
29:09
And at the end of the internship, for you to have a presentation with a demo. And during that journey, we'll give you like a lot of support.
29:15
Usually intern is supported by two people, the interim manager and then a body like an onboarding body or a mentor.
29:21
So then these two people are helping you move through all of those all of those things.
29:29
So what we want at the end of the internship, whether you decide to come back to Amazon or not,
29:33
is that you've actually we've actually help you developing that skill set,
29:39
the professional skill set industry experience,
29:42
as well as for you to actually get like a really good look on what is it like to be an Amazon and Amazon developer.
29:46
So a couple of questions on the board. So can I take an intern after graduation?
29:54
I am not sure we'll take that question to our recruiting department.
30:00
My experience has been that after regulation, we're really just looking to bring you in as a regular employee.
30:05
It's not an internship anymore. It's just like we'll bring you in at our junior level as the.
30:10
So happy to bring it to Amazon. Send me your résumé and our your internship promote this year.
30:16
So the answer is yes. So today, because of the current situation, Amazon, world wide world working from home.
30:23
That's my laundry, by the way. I'm sorry, I didn't realise.
30:31
But now you guys know I do wash my clothes, which is a positive.
30:35
So, yeah, our interns, unfortunately, they're working remotely.
30:40
We are doubling down on how to help you because work in remote and remote is obviously more difficult than in person.
30:44
So we spend a lot of energy and time to make sure that you're being welcome into the virtual team and to spend a lot of time with your.
30:53
The next question, what are the best locations for the Amazon internship?
31:01
So after being like I've been in Seattle, Washington, I've managed teams in Canada, Madrid and now London,
31:06
I think best location is a very much personal decision of the intern based upon multiple things.
31:13
Number one, obviously the location, right. Like if someone just wants to be in sunny weather, no rain.
31:21
Braly, London is not for you. If somebody really wants to be in Canada or what I'd like, obviously.
31:28
So that's that's personal. I, I assume the spirit of the question here is around project the interest and technical work.
31:34
And I think that's where you have a wide array of options because different locations in Amazon, they usually have like different businesses.
31:43
So if you're interested in working on drones, go to bearer's. If you're interested primarily on Primedia or eight of us, that's three.
31:52
Come to London if you're interested or like a lot of ops, idle US networking teams and go to Sydney.
32:00
So the best way to for you to pick the best location is talk to your doctor, the Amazon recording partner that do your thing.
32:08
Tell them about your interest and have them help guide you on what location and what themes are available.
32:16
You know, you also need to remember that on top of location preference and your preference, there's also like regulations and visas.
32:24
And then those changed by country, not only by the country where you want to go, but also by the countries where you're coming from.
32:32
So the best person to answer that is recruiting. I mean, I don't know if I cover everything.
32:38
Anything else you wanna go out on? Yeah, I think you've got everything. I didn't have anything else.
32:43
I think I just want to add one more point about internships, because I think one of our own,
32:48
the assessor, Harry, said we do big like real world problems that are solved by the interns.
32:52
And when none of our internships are anything about, like, menial work or just for the sake of a good example, as one of my interns last year,
32:57
but like an end to end up localisation control framework, for example, testing different languages before they launch across devices.
33:06
It's a hard problem to solve. So he sort of looked into that problem and and figured out like a UI Burton UI that essentially could control
33:14
the applications configuration remotely based on the device type on the device that you provide on the network,
33:24
and you can just configure that device. I want this particular language.
33:29
Then he sort of he reduce the time to setup and test end to end from like a week to like a few hours every day.
33:34
And that's the kind of real world impact v.c and then touch the problems that we that we picked every year as well.
33:42
So I just want to emphasise that point. I think you've got everything. All right.
33:49
Great. I mean, I also have a question for you guys. It's a more general one.
33:57
So one of the things that's I think always stood out for me about Amazon as a company is its obsession with customer service.
34:02
And, you know, whenever I've reported an issue to prime video or whatever,
34:12
I've been impressed that even though I might be using some obscure Blu ray player or something, right.
34:18
There somehow seems to be a good path of communication between the customer support person that you speak to and the technical people.
34:25
So after you've done some basic like diagnostics or whatever,
34:34
just to make sure that it's not a question of like just resetting the device or something like that,
34:38
there does seem somehow I mean,
34:44
I'm not sure what the mystical process is from behind when people report this issue or whether these are aggregated in some clever way or something.
34:46
But like, how active is that communication between the customers and the tech team?
34:56
And just like how responsive is it? And how do you decide, like, how many customers are affected by an issue?
35:02
And do you somehow, like, prioritise things according to that? Sure, I can I can probably take a shot at this.
35:10
Hurry this. I think we saw this and the result is a multiple blows to William.
35:19
I think one even really start picking up a problem to solve, I say.
35:25
As I discussed before, is that we look at how we can operationally solve that problem into an operational
35:29
excellence is something that the hold ourselves accountable to on our very high bar.
35:34
So in terms of everything, we build the house and show our people the monitoring for those expediencies as well.
35:40
For example, we tried to know how many customers use a particular feature.
35:45
And what's the health of the feature? And we have like a dual set of tools and solutions that are built by Amazon,
35:49
by different themes in Amazon to sort of have that visibility and alarming capabilities so that we know that,
35:57
hey, if there's a particular feature that's not being used by customers as much as we expect it to be used, we have an alarm for that.
36:03
So and we also said those sorts of react, being reactive to customer problems are very,
36:10
very low in the sense that they know if there's a very even if it's an issue that impacts a few customers, we would get to know about it.
36:16
That's how we solve it from from the technical standpoint, from building the application to operationally maintaining the application.
36:24
And if there is a particular issue that's being reported by the customer that doesn't address often that are clearly defined like SLA for each team
36:31
in terms of what are the tickets that what the customer issues that they're responsible for and what is the SLA on those and how to tackle them.
36:41
So each team within Amazon owns their own ticket.
36:50
Q Is that they have strong as a place against and and we have different security levels defined as well.
36:53
So that's something that we look at deeply to understand how our application helped us in terms of what we own, in terms of each team.
37:00
And that scares quite well across Amazon. And there is a direct contact from the customer customer character Akito to that ticket.
37:09
Q. Yeah. I wanted to add like like like some things in there,
37:16
because I think there's like a cultural component that is important for all of you to be aware of.
37:23
Right. So if you open your browser and then you Google this thing called Amazon Leadership Principles and you're going to find out,
37:28
there's these 14 guiding principles that we use in Amazon.
37:36
And these are these are ways of thinking. And these are just like tenants that help us make decisions.
37:40
And you'll see that the first one of them is customer obsession.
37:47
So unlike a lot of companies that they put like vision and mission statements that then nobody ever talks about again anymore,
37:50
like they give them they give in to the employee on day one in their employee manual.
37:58
And then everybody forgets about it. In Amazon, we actually really embrace these fourteen leadership principles and STROZ deliver results.
38:02
Customer obsessions, et cetera. So as a customer of this company, we do take it very seriously when we have failed our promise to our customer.
38:10
Right.
38:20
And we we have this concept of customer impacting issue, which basically means, you know, we thought like something is working and now is not working.
38:20
Our customer has been impacted. And behind that.
38:28
So behind the mechanism of you picking up the phone and we trying to figure out quickly how to get you back on line fully.
38:32
There are some more interesting thing to talk about, which is this process called correction of errors.
38:40
And the fundamental principle in here is when you have an issue and you know, as you are solid, you start working in industry,
38:45
you you quickly realise that a lot of times things get on fire and you're put in this
38:53
position of having to do patches and hacks to kind of like keep the trend going,
38:59
so to speak. In Amazon, we do spend time making sure that we understand what is the root cause of a problem.
39:03
So then we can have a solution in place that will prevent the problem from happening ever again.
39:12
And we do that, as I was saying, with this thing called correction of errors.
39:18
That is based on a principle called the five wise. So the idea is you just keep asking, why did this happen?
39:22
And then the answer to you and then you ask, why was that?
39:29
And then they answer you and you keep asking why until you actually get to the root cause of of of the issue.
39:32
And now that you've identified those one or many root causes, then you can actually put a long term fix to that.
39:39
This is not like I'm an Amazon secret.
39:46
Like I actually welcome you to go and look at correction of Eric's processes, how to identify the root causes, the five.
39:48
Why mechanism? Because these are actually like good tool for you and your professional life or anywhere that you end up with is to not less.
39:56
Don't miss the forest for the trees just because the trees are on fire.
40:04
You should always try to, like, slow down.
40:08
Look at the big picture and then try to make sure that you have a fix in place that will prevent this from happening again.
40:11
Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. I like your analogy about the trees of the forest big on fire and having to deal with it.
40:18
Well, it's it's happening. That's pretty good. All right. Anybody else have a question?
40:24
Please feel free to post it in the chat or put your hand up or just go ahead and ask.
40:35
OK. So do you need any follow up information from ore's or from the facilitator of these meetings?
40:47
Do you know where to reach out, Glamazon? In case you're interested on an internship or a full time job?
40:53
Yes, you can just recap that information, that would be great. And then I think we can bring it to a close.
41:01
OK, cool. So I'm gonna put it here, my my illington information.
41:07
So I'm on this thing. I've been in this thing for like 20 years now.
41:12
Happy to connect to any of you, particularly Arminda, me and a lot of, um, Estonians.
41:15
Whenever we're looking for talent, like we always go to LinkedIn and we like, you know, throw an announcement or whatever.
41:21
So feel free to connect, you know. So it's a good tool. The best place to find jobs once you radway, is Amazon.
41:27
Those jobs just like that, Amazon, the job or just Google, Amazon, the jobs, you can then filter by location.
41:37
You can filter by skill set. You can filter by, you know, preference on domains.
41:45
Your family, etc, etc are pretty common. Pretty standard like Gelbaum.
41:51
I mean, I don't know if we have a specific recruitment context or is the job also numbers on jobs?
41:57
I think Hannah said she would reach out to the students as well to an email with all the details required.
42:04
So that can would choose your reporting. Contact is the one, you know, making sure to reach out to Amazon.
42:09
We don't look for people that have specific technical knowledge.
42:17
So for us, it's really not very important that, you know, Rijad or JavaScript or C++.
42:21
What is important for us is to get the students and employees that have the computer science foundational like strong.
42:27
Right. So we want people, that kind of thing.
42:37
So your algorithms, your data structures, how do you apply those on real world problems for you to be able to talk to us about?
42:39
How do you believe you've demonstrated leadership principles in your past experiences,
42:47
which is perfectly fine if there are school experiences like pride with your co-workers for a particular assignment and that type of thing.
42:52
And yeah. And we would love to have any any any of you that have interest in joining Amazon.
43:00
I want to personally thank you for spending time with us. I know we'd remove some time from your day to day work and your lunch break.
43:06
So I hope you were having a sandwich on the other side. And thank you very much, Arvind.
43:14
Anything before we leave? Yeah. Thanks, everyone. It's been really happy to speak to your.
43:19
No, that's great. Thanks very much, Ivan. Hey, that was a very insightful talk.
43:27
The nice thing I like about these talks is that I think you always learn something about something from these talks,
43:32
and we certainly learnt a lot today. So thank you very much for that.
43:40
Thank you. Wonderful. Have a great father. We welcome your comments.
43:45
